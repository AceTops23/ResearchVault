"A web portal is a web-based platform that provides user to user interaction with 
a single access point of data. It also can be used to enhance the collaboration of 
information and improve the way of communication of every user. Nowadays, web 
portal is commonly used in educational sector such as schools and university and 
applied it in their program for easily dissemination of material needed for their lecture. 
It is a tool designed to support the educational objectives of teachers and learners; they 
provide access to resources for enhancing the educational opportunities of 
contemporary learners.
OJT (On-the-Job Training) is one of the practicums taken by the students within 
their fields. All of the students, including Junior High, Senior High, and most likely, 
College students, are conducting their training or taking units off the practicum to 
engage in a hands-on exercise that they can apply in the workplace once they are 
graduated. It helps the students to improve performance at the workplace and adds more 
diversified experience and abilities while enriching the self- acquired proficiencies 
coming from the practices they are learning. Students have to undergo OJT for at least 
its minimum duration, depending on the field they are exploring. All students must also 
complete their training as it is required to get their diploma. 
On the other hand, Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa Cruz- Main 
Campus curriculum include the OJT 401 (On-the-Job Training (500 Hours) or OJT 
400B (BPO Internship 2(400 Hours) for the College of Computer Studies that student 
must go through to the program to be able to passed the subject and to graduate 
eventually, thus dissemination of forms needed to the program is having a hard 
experience for both OJT adviser and student when it comes communication such as giving forms for students individually, different platforms to post an announcement, 
uploading of forms, submitting of forms, overload paperwork for adviser due to the 
number of students, not having a platform intended only for OJT matters.
Therefore, the researcher believes that the present study is a great response to 
the challenge of accepting new methods of performing OJT/Internship of the university. 
This will serve as another medium to improve the school’s processes in conducting 
OJT/Internship program, providing the uploading and submission of requirements, 
centralized web platform intended for OJT and create an updated announcement.",Introduction
"Laguna States Polytechnic University curriculum includes On the Job Training 
(OJT) for students supervised by their OJT adviser, which is an important area that 
integrates teaching space knowledge and concept with hands-on application and 
developed skills in professional or social acceptance. It provides benefits for students 
while completing both degrees and pursuing a promising future ahead mention by Julie 
Maio (2018), in her article entitled ""10 Reasons why an internship is important to all 
students"". 
Enrolled student in OJT will expected to cater all the needed requirements 
before they attempt to find a place to apply for their internship program. The OJT 
adviser role is to guide their students in the process of their application regarding 
companies and some institutions that hire or accept OJT students and also, they are 
responsible in distributing all the requirements covering Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA), Waiver, Accomplishment Form, Acceptance form and some forms necessity 
in OJT. This can be done manually especially the forms that needs signature of the 
College Dean and OJT Adviser therefore students will go to school to acquire the 
requirements. This cause conflict of schedule between the students and the adviser. As well as on looking at a workplace to conduct OJT is barely time-consuming and for the 
reason that students will do the walk-in process, and others will look in an online job 
site. However, due to numerous sites, it still consumes time and money. The researcher 
came up with the idea to create an OJT portal for LSPU because they be likely to ask 
the adviser thru chat and sending of requirements thru some other platforms in the 
internet and it causes chaos for the adviser due to all students will do the same. 
The researcher is capable to develop the “LSPU Students: OJT Web Portal” in 
which it would be beneficial for the students and OJT advisers in terms of uploading 
requirements in the portal, providing job posting and company link for internship 
program and also announcement given by the adviser. These research questions were 
expressed that will support the development of the study (1) how to develop a portal 
for the LSPU OJT students in finding a workplace to conduct their OJT? (2) how to 
create a portal that can distributes requirements? (3) how to evaluate the efficiency of 
the system. ",Method
"Population of the Study
The target population for this research defined to include the OJT 
coordinator/Adviser/Dean and graduate students of SY 2019-2020 in LSPU, while the 
accessible population is the OJT coordinator/Adviser/Dean and graduate students from
College of Computer Studies since 2019-2020 hence, these are the OJT 
coordinator/Adviser/Dean and graduate students within the researcher’s reach. In this 
study, the accessible population comprised all the OJT coordinator/Adviser/Dean and 
graduate students of College of Computer Studies SY 19-20.
Data Collection Method 
The researchers used various methods to collect data and information to 
understand better the current process of conducting OJT. The researchers acquire the 
problem that occurred in implementing OJT to their students. Below are the methods 
that the researchers used to gather information on behalf of the study.
Interview 
The researcher interviewed in several department, specifically the OJT 
coordinator, wherein data and needs for the development of this study have acquired, 
such as handling OJT students of their adviser, finding a workplace for OJT students, 
and how OJT works.
Online Research 
The researcher also consumed time on online research. Thus, internet research 
has numerous result it helps the researcher to sort out that information related to the 
study. On the other hand, some related studies have been attained then it serves as the 
guide for the researcher to support this study's development.
Library Research
Besides online, the researcher also seeks knowledge for various Thesis 
correlated to this study. Based on the researcher's readings, the researcher attains ideas 
and outlook for the progress of this study.
Observation
The researchers conducted an observation in this study to gather additional 
information regarding to the study and to the developmental of the system.
Questionnaire
The researchers used the questionnaire to get feedback from the users of the 
system. Furthermore, it was to conduct a testing for the functionality of the system.",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interference of the data result acquired 
from the surveys conducted by the researchers after the system was developed. It also 
discusses if the researcher’s study has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of the client.",Discussion
