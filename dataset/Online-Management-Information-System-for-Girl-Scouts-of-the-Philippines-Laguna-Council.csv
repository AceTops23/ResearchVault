"The responsibility of technology has made an individual‘s life more 
comfortable and facile. The complexities of current technology, such as gadgets, help 
people gather information and perform a task in a faster and easier process. 
Technology nowadays has been advancing rapidly, that new applications are being 
discovered that are much advance and process information much uncomplicated. 
Technology updates the most complex of the process in business, education, or any 
other industry. The critical and time-consuming process can be lessening and ease the 
work done if the technology is applied.
In today's technology, tools are available for researchers to make things easier 
and to manage things. Technology is essentially an instrument for solving the topic of 
how to interact with others. And how things are resolved faster than ever before. 
Technology also plays an important role in government organizations. It would be a 
great advantage for them, to have an upgraded technology to help their processes 
more automated, organized, and giving them the perfect and on-time data that they 
needed.
The Girl Scouts of the Philippines serves eight hundred thousand members as 
of 2017. According to the Republic Act no. 10073 section 2, stated that the State 
affirms the contribution of the Girl Scouts of the Philippines to the promotion of 
positive values, responsible citizenship, and volunteerism to the young woman 
through its faithful adherence to the fundamental principles of the World Association 
Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, an internationally recognized organization (PHILIPPINE 
LAWS, STATUTES, and CODES, 2010).Girls Scout association aims to help girls and young women realize the ideals 
of womanhood and prepare themselves for the responsibilities in the home, the nation, 
and the world community. The selected organization of the proponents is located at 
Los Ba?os, Laguna. The Council Executive of GSP mentioned that they have an 
estimated of more than 100,000 members through Laguna that were registered in their 
office. Their office handles the recording of the membership profile and events 
coordinating of the Girls Scout within Laguna. The GSP procedure for registering 
their member is in order by manual process. As the researchers investigate their 
current process, they noticed hassle situations that slowed down the GSP process. The 
troop leaders are required to go to the Girl Scouts office to fill up the registration 
forms and submit them directly to the staff of the GSP. 
Due to the pandemic that spread in 2020, it became difficult for the GSP to 
persuade members so they decided to adjust to the difficult situation. According to the 
Facebook group of GSP Laguna Council, the GSP staff strives to convey the troop 
registration form. They go sequentially to the house of each troop leader to fill up the 
registration form. The problem in this study is (a) how to resolve the very long, 
tedious process for the registration. (b) On how to access data or record of each 
member (c) How they access the data when they want to update, delete, search save 
the data and lastly (d) how to easily view each member's profile and council events 
GSP - Laguna.
The researchers come up with a solution to provide an online platform that 
would provide all the files and papers and would help their office to facilitate the 
manual process to serve the clients and future clients of the Girl Scout easily and 
conveniently. The website contains the membership registrations, daily cash 
collection reports, and monthly monitoring of Girl scouts membership.
",Introduction
"The Girl Scouts of the Philippines - Laguna Council, handles the Girl Scout 
curriculum of every school, barangay, and district in the entire province of Laguna 
with more than 100,000 members. Their office can be found near the Municipality of 
Los Baños, Laguna. It is the one who manages the members in the province of 
Laguna and the one responsible for passing the member‘s information to the Girl 
Scout of the Philippines National Headquarters located in Manila. Consistently troop 
leaders visit the GSP- Laguna Council to make their school or district a member of 
the Girl Scout of the Philippines.
The GSP-Laguna council office issues a registration form that must be filled 
by a troop leader, counting the fees required to pay for their participation. Troop 
leader submits the filled up form with payment and, the GSP staff records them and 
sends their records to the GSP National headquarters. The problem in this study is 
how to resolve the very long, tedious process for the registration, how to access data 
or record of each member and how they access the data when they want to update, 
delete, search and save the data. And lastly, how to easily view each member's profile 
and council events GSP - Laguna.
With the citation problem encountered in manual setup, the researchers come 
up with the idea to make an online management information system that will give 
easier access for registering online. A system that will provide the website which
contains the membership registrations, daily cash collection reports, and monthly 
monitoring of Girl scouts membership. And to build a system that will compile and 
execute all data of the member in their organization.",Method
"Population of the Study
The population of the study focused on the locale of the study – the whole 
Districts of Laguna – District 1 (Sta. Rosa, Laguna and San Pedro, Laguna are not 
included to the locale of the study.) District 2, District 3 and District 4. An estimated 
total of 96,000 registered members based on the record of GSP-Laguna Council 
Office as of 2017. 
The researchers observed that managing, organizing data, and registering the 
troop leaders and members of the girl scouts works through a manual process. The 
researchers have come up with the idea for developing a system that will help the 
employee of GSP to manage, organize, and register troop leaders and members of 
GSP through an online platform.Data Collection Method
The study entitled ?Online Management Information System for Girl Scouts of 
the Philippines- Laguna Council"" needed accurate and mathematically significant data 
from GSP-Laguna Council. In the process of data gathering, the researchers had to 
devise a strategic course of action in collecting, analyzing, and representing the data 
from various points of the study. The following are the main methods used in 
gathering the information needed for the investigation to proceed:
Observations
The researchers immersed themselves in the community to observe the state of 
technology in the area. In this method of data collection, the primary focus of the 
researcher is to know the current registration process on the organization. The 
researchers observe how the GSP monitors the members of each district. The 
researchers took down notes on their observations and carefully analyzed the nature 
and the processes involved in the actual current state of the client‘s technology.
Interviews
After careful considerations, the researcher then proceeded to conduct a series 
of interviews from the population of the study. The interview method as a verbal 
method is quite significant in securing data about all these aspects. In this method, the 
researchers interact with the client and respondents to know their inner feelings and 
reactions. The interview is a direct method of inquiry.It is simply stated as a social process in which a person known as the 
interviewer asks questions usually in a face to face contact with the other person or 
persons known as interviewees or interviewees. However, due to the situation gives 
by the pandemic some of interview and asking questions have conducted online. The 
researchers respond to these, and the researchers collects various information from 
these responses through a very healthy and friendly social interaction. The researchers 
used this method in order further to gain knowledge on the experience of the 
administrators.
Questionnaire
The researchers, after conducting a series of interviews, then devised several 
sets of inquiries to be answered by a strategically selected sample from the population 
of the study. Questionnaire is devices for securing answers to questions by using a 
form that the respondent fills in himself. These questionnaires were handed out to the 
sample population and then taken back for data analysis and representation. This 
technique is extremely useful because the researchers were able to gather a large sum 
of information within a concise amount of time.
Internet Research
The researchers have used online research as one of the method for data 
collection. With the help of the internet, the researchers have gather ideas and 
information that are related and would help them for their study. The internet has a lot 
of information all over the world that the researcher can apply to their study. The 
information that the researchers have gathered can help for the development of the 
system",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test result 
accompanying the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also analyzed if the system 
entitled ""Online Management Information System for Girl Scouts of the Philippines –
Laguna Council"" has fulfilled the needs of the clients and its objective.
Research Objectives
