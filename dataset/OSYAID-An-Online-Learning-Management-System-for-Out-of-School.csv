"Information Technology has provided humans a big leap for every task 
in terms of communications, production, entertainment, information 
dissemination and etc. Over the years, technology gradually progresses. It 
continuously grows its demand and constant evolution. It is widely recognized 
that learners are motivated and purposefully engaged in the learning process 
when concepts and skills are underpinned with technology and sound 
pedagogy. Education provides advice on resources for practitioners, parents 
and pupils to engage with these technologies in order to inform and enhance 
the learning experience.
At the present dynamic education, the education system has
transformed to create a new generation of students who can adapt with the 
new technologies and are able to access and manage the information 
explosion. The student population in higher education is changing. The 
dynamic state of technological development has made perpetual learning a 
necessity. For the reason, more and more adults are returning to school to 
learn new skills or expand the skills they already have.
A Learning Management System (LMS) is a powerful resource for 
employers focused on training and professional development, whether it’s for 
staffing agencies or extension schools or corporations. This powerful software 
combine’s database Management with the digital framework for managing curricular, training materials and evaluation tools. The impact of a LMS is 
mostly felt outside of traditional educational institutions, though the same 
technology is slowly finding its way into even those entities.
LMS has become a powerful tool for consulting companies that 
specialize in staffing and training, extension schools, and any corporation 
looking to get a better grasp on the continuing education of its workforce. Its 
impact has been felt mostly outside of traditional education institutions, though 
the same technological and market forces are dramatically changing today’s 
classroom as well.
The traditional application of an LMS is in educational institutions have 
been used for several years to deliver courseware in schools and popularize 
e-learning. In the last few decades, companies have been using LMS to 
deliver training to internal employees and customers. Technology has 
become a powerful tool for consulting companies that specialize in staffing 
and training, extension schools, and any corporation looking to get a better 
grasp on the continuing education of its workforce. Its impact has been felt 
mostly outside of traditional education institutions, though the same 
technological and market forces are dramatically changing today’s classroom 
as well.
The Out of School Youth who is within the age of compulsory 
attendance, but has not attended school for at least the most recent complete 
school year calendar quarter. Youth are an eligible youth who is a school 
dropout; or an eligible youth who has received a secondary school diploma or 
its equivalent but is basic skills deficient, unemployed, or underemployed.

",Introduction
"Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of 
knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include 
storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. In fact,
innovations were already present nowadays compared to the past. The use of 
technology is one of these innovations. The developed project is intended to 
create a system “Learning Management System for Out of School Youth” it is 
a system where a learner can learn more about the different Office 
Application and PC Troubleshooting. The OSY need to learn more about the 
Microsoft Office and PC Troubleshooting because nowadays many job offers 
need an applicant who have a knowledge about this and is also should be 
computer literate.
The first phase of the study aims to design and develop a Learning 
Management for Out of School Youth using web base system that can 
manage the learning tools to improve the skills and knowledge of OSY. 
Specifically, it aimed (1) to develop a learning management system to 
increase the knowledge of Out of School Youth; (2) to identify the 
programming language, database and development tools to be use in the 
development of the proposed system; (3) to formulate a procedure and 
guidelines in the implementation accomplished the objectives.
The second phase of the study entitled “OSYAID: LMS” sought to find 
out the general research questions confirmed through the validity of the 
developed Learning Management System. Specifically, the researcher aimed 
to answer the following questions; (a) how to test the functionality of the 
software by the users? (b) how to assess the acceptability and the 
behavioural intention of the users in utilizing the develop learning 
management system? (c) how to develop an implementation plan for the 
proposal project for the students?",Method
"Data Gathering Procedure
This the complete evaluation of an initiative in order to identify the 
system needs. All the techniques that the researchers used in conducting the 
research study are thus presented below. From the time when the proponents 
started conducting the research, they analysed the possible difficulties that 
they may encounter during the research.Library Research
The library served as the main source of information for the 
researchers. They can read and gathered information from books, magazine, 
newspaper and previous research studies to be familiarized and enhance 
their knowledge about the project. They also did a brainstorming to share their 
knowledge and opinions regarding the research and requirements.
Internet Research
The internet is one of the most important sources of information 
especially about worldwide information that the researchers used. By 
searching the internet, the researchers gathered significant information and 
ideas that are related to the project by means of principle and functions, like 
related literatures and related studies.
Interview
The researchers also conducted interviews to know the different 
problems that the client is encountering during the development phase of the 
system. In this method, the researchers distinguished how the system would
work. It was used to investigate and gather specific information needed.
Consultant
The consultants are very important in the part of researchers, they 
were able to know whether the study is possible or not. The consultant is 
aware of the process and ideas on how the study works. By knowing this, the 
consultant was be able to add more features and ideas about the study. 
Hence, the researchers gained more knowledge.

",Result
"The Results and Discussion presents the analysis and interpretation of 
the tests results acquired from the conducted techniques by the researchers. 
It also discusses if the study entitled “OSYAID: An Online Learning 
Management System for Out of School Youth” has satisfied and fulfilled the 
needs of its user.
