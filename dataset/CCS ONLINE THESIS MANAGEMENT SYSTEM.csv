"In our fast-changing society, technology is making a huge innovation in almost everything. People nowadays are always updated most specially with the latest trend of technology that will make their living easier and comfortable. One of the roots of this gigantic change in our generation are computers. Computers have already renovated our lives through communicating, working, learning things and even the simplest routine that we do every day. Fortunately, computers serves a very important role to everyone including students, computers help students not only by means of pleasure and entertainment but most especially on their study. Students of this generation are more into easy and fast way of learning. In that case, they need various and innovative ways of gathering information and reference tools that could help in their studies. Libraries are one of the most known and equipped place to go for information and reference, usually for study and education purpose. Not all libraries can provide all the books that the students need, in accordance to this, they provide technological materials that can aid the need for the missing or incomplete references and information. This technology includes electronic sources such as electronic journals, multimedia content and electronic books.
Nowadays, people live in a modernized world. Modernization is now a big part of the industry, economy, and even in education. One of this is digitization. Digitizing is the art of converting the contents of a document from hard copy into machine-readable format. It makes the materials easy to access and available electronically, it also serves a purpose of preserving the material. Any type of information can be represented in digital form, such as pictures, musical works, text, computer programs, databases, models and designs, video programs, and any other works combining many types of information. A person that is need of information can easily click, type and search for the information needed in just a matter of seconds. It does not only made searching and information gathering easy but also it saves a lot of time and effort not only for students and teachers but for everyone who’s in need.
The Researchers created the Online Thesis Management System of the Laguna State Polytechnic University, College of Computer Studies, to provide them the information and references needed for researching. It is made exclusively for CCS students and made accessible through student identification number. It will serves as a reference guide for the students who will make their own thesis. Research coordinators will be the one to monitor every student who are conducting their research through the use of a single computer unit. The students will just do some typing and clicking then search for the specific information they need effortless while saving their time.
",Introduction
"Project Context
There is no doubt that internet is now the primary and basic need when it comes to information gathering. It is undeniable that it’s a lot easier to search through internet than browsing one book to another then write all the information you found then do it on another item and so on. This redundancy takes a lot of time and effort.
In the College of the Computer Studies of LSPU-SCC, they still manually manage the thesis information. The assigned personnel manually check the forms, copies of abstract and the CD copies. After the verification of the thesis copies, they will arrange it to its designated rack with logical sequence, meaning the thesis should be arranged according to the year. There are specific problems that the research coordinator encountered in the thesis area and those are not enough space for the old manuscript, they cannot monitor the students who vandalized the manuscript and it is difficult to retrieve information.
The researchers developed the “Online Thesis Management System CCS” to lessen the problems that the research coordinator encountered in monitoring and checking of thesis books. It would help in monitoring the use in order to avoid vandalism of the original manuscript. With this system, the end-user would easily retrieve the digitized copies of thesis from the thesis area of College of Computer Studies. It will also provide archive of old manuscript and save space at the thesis area of College of Computer Studies. The study was believed to be of great help for teachers and students as it provides them with the information on the availability of the study materials and also for the research coordinator to provide enough information.
The client of the researchers is LSPU SCC CCS Deans Office. It is located at Brgy. Bubukal Sta. Cruz, Laguna. The project aimed to answer the following questions: (a) What are the devices that should be used to operate thesis management system? (b) What application software should be used to open website? (c) What techniques or process should be formulated to improve the existing system?
Population of the Study
     The researcher came up with the total number of respondents with the help of a statician. The Majority of the data required for the study conducted with the use of its prospective users. Prosprective users were tasked to evaluate the propsed system according to the given criteria.There were a total of eight (8) respondents which came from one (1) IT expert and seven (7) system user. They were chosen because they would be one who would use of the system that the researchers would develop and they were the reason ehy the system was developed.
",Method
"The researchers choose the purposive sampling technique based on who think would be appropriate for the study. Researchers used purposive sampling technique because the scope of the study was only for Dean and the students of College of Computer Studies LSPU Main Campus. Therefore, students and administrator has access use the system.   
 Consultant. With the help of a consultant, the researchers were able to know if the proposed project was feasible or not. They learned and gained more ideas about the proposed study from her. They were able to know how it will work as well as the components and devices that will be needed and used in building up the proposed system.
System Adviser helpful the researchers in creating the system. The SA gave advice and suggestion  to make the system more efficient and the SA also gave ideas to the researchers on building the software. With the help of the System Adviser, the researchers analyzed and built the system easily. The SA  gave to the researchers ideas on building and enhancing the software.
Internet research was used by the researchers to make the feasibility of the study. Personal computer and rented computers are the medium used for internet browsing. They gathered the needed information and data to be used in the proposed system. The internet is the main source of codes that was used in building and creating the system.
",Result
The College of Computer Studies can provide hardware and software resources that can fully support the implementation of the developed system. ,Discussion
