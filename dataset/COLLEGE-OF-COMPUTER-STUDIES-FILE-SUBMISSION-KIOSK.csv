"The innovation of technology is advancing constantly in the different
fields of industry. Its continuous change helps people do their job faster and 
people can focus more on the important factors in life. Technology helps them 
improve the way they live and the way they can perform their task as efficient 
as possible. It also helps the people save more of their time and energy which 
mean they can do more in creating a technology that can enhance other task 
that are usually done by humans. Technology is very significant in everyone’s 
life because it benefits more in their life.
The continuous growth of technology leads from the old machineries 
into new ones. Social Medias on the other way around also improves its 
features which makes people’s lifestyle easy. Through the use of internet,
people can stay connected to the world. One of its best features is how 
people can send files instantly with just a click of a button. 
However, sending files without the use of internet requires a faster 
response. Like for example in schools or universities, if a student have to 
send a file or task is given to them, they can either look for the professor or 
teacher or just put it on his/her desk. The advantage of staying connected with 
the internet is that you can send file as easy as it can be. You just have to 
attach the file and click send and you have your file sent to its designated 
receiver. It also have its time and date in case a person wants to check what 
time or date a person sent a file.
Technology has its endless improvement, humans will continue to 
upgrade the old generation into a new, modern and technology-like 
generation. Like Kiosk, people create technology that is very useful to the 
environment and awareness. Kiosk is a small structure that provides 
information and services on a computer screen. Kiosks let users interact and 
include touch screens, sound, and motion video. A number of companies 
specialize in creating multimedia kiosks. A simple kiosk can be created 
using HTML pages and graphics, setting the type size large enough to attract
people from a short distance, and removing the Web browser's tool bar so 
that the display screen is effectively in ""kiosk mode."" The presentation can be 
designed to simply loop through a series of pages or to allow user interaction 
and exploration.
The Laguna State Polytechnic University – Sta.Cruz, Campus, College 
of Computer Studies (CCS) are currently experiencing conflicts when it comes 
to sending files like projects or any kinds of printouts and paper works which 
results to frustrations of professors when it comes to its deadlines. The idea of 
the study is to send files through a kiosk within the College of Computer 
Studies. The Kiosk will print a receipt that will serve as evidence of the time 
and date and to whom professor it is for.
The researcher’s goal of sending files through a kiosk is to avoid 
circumstances with time and deadlines as well as to lessen the exhausted 
way and time consuming way of sending files and provide a more user friendly system and manipulate it with ease.
The general objective of the study was to develop a kiosk with regards 
to sending files that can give the students an effortlessness in sending their 
projects or requirements together with the exact time and date that they 
passed it as well as to whom professor it is for. The researcher come up with
the title; “College of Computer Studies File Submission Kiosk” that mainly 
uses an All-in-One Touchscreen Monitor, Thermal Printer, Barcode Scanner, 
Arduino Uno with Servo Motor and a broadband stick together with an 
improvise Kiosk.",Introduction
"The modernization of generation also leads to technologies 
innovations. These new technologies helps people in different aspects of their 
life. It helps them do their task easily and it also helps them to develop an 
even greater technology for the generation to use in a more advanced way. 
One technology that adapts from the older development of file submission is 
the “CCS File Submission Kiosk”.
The research project entitled; “CCS File Submission Kiosk” was 
intended to keep the submission of files organized. It is a computer system 
that gathers files from the students that needs to be sent to the designated 
professors. This computer system benefits more to the CCS students as well 
as their professors.
The study was made to have a hassle-free sending files by using a 
kiosk technology. Students who are currently enrolled will have to register in 
order to use the technology. They will provide their own username and 
password in order to access the system. They will have to choose which 
professor they are sending it to and then click “Submit”. The system will both 
send an SMS notification to the professor that it has been sent, and prints the 
first copy of receipt for the receiver. Hard copy of files should be inserted 
inside an envelope before attaching the receipt. When the receipt has been 
attached, the file is now ready to be inserted inside the kiosk. But before it 
completely falls down to the storage of the files inside the kiosk, it will be 
prevented to fall before dropping down because of the lock on the edge of the 
tray of the kiosk, the purpose of this is to give the barcode scanner an ample 
time to read the barcode that was generated by the printer. The purpose of 
this is to give the barcode scanner enough time to scan the barcode that was 
generated by the printer and to reassure that a student sent a file. When the 
scanner scans the barcode, the lock will eventually open or will rotate for 10 
seconds so the file can finally drop down, and then, the printer prints the 
second copy of receipt for the sender’s copy. This computer system 
technology is proposed to avoid time conflicts as well as to save time and 
energy.
The College of Computer Studies often experience time or deadline 
conflicts for the teachers while students consumes time looking for their 
professors, deciding if they are going to place it in their professors desk or 
look for them within the department or the university. These often leads to
experiencing difficulties in having proofs that they passed their projects on the 
right time. With the help of this study, sending files became hassle-free.
The project targets to answer the following questions: (1) How to 
develop a system that will help the Dean from the CCS in the automation of 
the process? (2) How to develop and design a software that will best 
complement the hardware? (3) How to integrate the hardware and software to 
be able to improve the process of sending file through a kiosk? (4) How to 
determine the satisfactoriness of the project in terms of; Quality Factors, 
Perceived of Ease of Use, Experience, Actual Use. (5) How to evaluate the 
overall performance of the system based on the above criteria.",Method
"In order to gather several information for the continuous development 
of the project, some methods needs to be done. The following methods are 
the ones that was performed by the researcher to collect data, strengthen 
facts and to help the researcher support the development of the study.
Observation
Before undergoing the construction of the project, the researcher first 
held an observation about it. Through this, method the researcher found out 
several problems that the students as well as the professors encounter when 
it comes to sending their files. 
Additionally, with the information the researcher have gathered, the
concept and ideas to make the study much reliable and understandable.
Library Research
Library research was also done to gather additional information for 
more relevant sources and basis of the system. It helped the researcher
support the project and added more features that helped the system become
possible.
Internet Research
Research on the internet also needs was performed in order to support 
and strengthen the ideas and concepts and also to include secondary 
information and ideas. Questionnaire
Fact-Finding Technique was used by the researchers to collect data 
and other information through questionnaires and feedbacks. The hardware 
as well as the software involved in the study was tested and evaluated by the 
students and professors of CCS. After testing and implementing, the 
researcher gave out a set of questions in a questionnaires to the students so 
that their answer could identify how effective and useful this study will be.",Result
"This chapter presents the presentations and the detailed analysis of the 
data gathered as well as the interpretation of the data pertaining to the 
research problems, which this study investigated.
