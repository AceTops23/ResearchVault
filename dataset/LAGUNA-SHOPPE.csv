"Computers are very helpful in a way that it is easier to research, better 
gaming, easier communication and helps work be faster. It offers good benefits 
for different kinds of user. Moreover, the continuous development of computer 
makes a big impact globally in many aspects. In today’s environment, there are 
many retail outlets, manufactures, and other businesses continue to rely on the 
use of computers like businesses that sells their products online, which is called 
as “Electronic Commerce” or “e-commerce”.
E-commerce is a system that allows online movements, buying and 
selling goods services and information. It can be described as an electronic 
market where sellers and buyers can communicate and offers its products, 
services and payments virtually or digitally. These business transactions occurs 
either business to business, business to consumer, consumer to consumer or 
consumer to business. E-commerce is getting more attentions from 
entrepreneur and consumers around the globe due to highly successful 
companies on the internet. According to Pasadilla (2013), he stated that in the 
Philippines, e-commerce is mostly being implemented by major retailers and 
multinational corporations for bank to bank exchange. A number of business –
to-consumer transactions have emerges through the years such as auctions, 
online shopping, and online banking. This just shows that Filipino businesses 
welcome this new opportunity in selling goods since 16% of the population is 
using internet. This new marketing strategy will not benefit the big companies but focus 
on small businesses who cannot afford to advertise their products. Just by 
creating a website in a very affordable cost would make the businesses grow 
in terms of sales and enhance company image as well.
According to Toral (2014), as Filipinos entered the 21st century, local e commerce transaction reached Php 1 billion. It shows that there’s at least one 
billion transaction sales growth annually if this trend continues, figures can 
search up to Php 20 billion economic growth takes place in the next 10 years, 
these estimates may even double or triple. This shows that e-commerce is
mostly used by marketers that is a big help for the businesses when it comes 
to increasing of their sales same for other marketers that wants to enlarge their 
sales.
From this current state of technology the researchers choose the 
possibility of conducting a research about a system that will provide a virtual 
buy and sell business exclusively for the different business around Laguna. 
Through the system, the included stores can now manage and improve their 
businesses through online like promoting their products and selling it at the 
same time. Orderly keeping of transaction records, accurately computing of 
sales, monitoring of sales, and efficient transaction to the customer for the 
different towns around Laguna to be known more on its products is the goal of 
this study. Consumers can now virtually shop in different stores around Laguna
providing many options then buy the products they want at the same time even 
they’re at home. Also, they can check all the transactions they did virtually.
",Introduction
"As of today, stores that chose to improve their business and wants to 
increase their sales uses social networking sites to easily promote and sell their 
products. However, not all the marketers use this kind of business strategy for 
the reason that some of this retail establishment owners doesn’t know the 
advantage of using this newly improved business marketing strategy. 
Laguna is one of the best economy contributors and noted for its tourist 
spots, crops, handicrafts, barong and barong materials, woodcarvings and 
Paper Mache figures. Many of these businesses are still relying in traditional 
commerce. Customers from other cities, towns or countries that can’t personally 
visit and shop are not able to buy their wanted products from different stores 
around Laguna. Due to this, business reach is very limited from where they are 
located that they can only advertise their store by the use of their calling card 
which they give to walk in customers and their common customers that results 
in less income unlike for those online businesses. For the customer to purchase 
the items they’re about to buy, they need to go in the cashier then wait for their 
turn to pay. The store owner or employees compute all the sold items manually 
using digital calculator after writing it on the blank receipt, they put carbon paper 
underneath of it for their own transaction copy and the true copy will be received
by the purchaser, that takes so much time for both customers and employees. 
This continues relying in manual process leads in many problems such as more 
time be consumed, losing of data, less sales and productivity, poor 
management and prone to human error.
The researchers aimed to design and create a system entitled “Laguna 
Shop: An E-Commerce Platform”. This e-commerce platform would help the 
Province of Laguna and its marketers to expand their business’ reach to 
become more productive in terms of selling their products. The e-commerce 
platform aimed to improve the managing of business by providing Laguna 
businesses a comfortable and convenient way of virtually buying and selling
thus increasing the interest of the customers demand in buying. Also the store 
owners can now easily manage and monitor their businesses, saves time and 
effort and lessen the human errors.
During the first phase of the study the researchers came up to this 
following research objectives in developing Laguna Shoppe: An e-commerce 
Platform that will help Laguna marketers and consumers: (1) to design and 
develop a web-based system called Laguna Shoppe: An E-commerce Platform;
(2) to identify the suitable programming languages in developing the system. 
(3) to determine the right development tool for the study.
The study proceeded to its second phase, in this phase the researchers 
knew the research problems in the developed system “Laguna Shoppe: An E commerce Platform. To know the effectiveness of the system, the researchers 
specifically wanted to answer the following research questions: (1) How to 
identify the appropriate evaluation tool to be use in evaluating the effectiveness 
of the developed system? (2) How to determine the level of conformity of 
Laguna Shoppe: An E-commerce Platform with regards to ISO9126 standards? 
(3) How to evaluate the acceptability of the system to the intended users?
",Method
"After the approval of the title proposal, the researchers had some 
brainstorming to generate ideas in order to get started with their study. 
The following instruments or tools were used by the researchers in 
gathering data for the study. The researchers used this as basis for drawing 
conclusions or making assumptions. These instrument or tools are interviews, 
observations, internet research, library research, and questionnaires.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interview in different retail establishment 
in Laguna where they gathered the data by asking questions to get the needed 
information from the interview.

programming languages, tools and design that would be needed and be used 
in building-up the proposed system. It is also done to know if the study was 
feasible or not.",Result
"This section discusses the analysis and interpretation of the test results 
as well as the observations on the limits of the system’s capability.
