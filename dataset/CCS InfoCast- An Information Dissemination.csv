"Technology and communication are two of the most common things in the world today especially now that we are entering a fast modernization process. While communication is necessary in every relation, technology makes messages or information delivered at the right time with the right content. Whether it is in social media or mass media, the transfer of communication has brought great importance to schools, businesses and other establishments. For an individual belonging to a certain establishment, it would be advantageous to know all the updates, upcoming events, important announcements and all the latest news around you.
The use of the internet and social media has become a solution to it but this was not the case all the time. One can either get false information from an invalid source or a made up announcement.
This study is about the creation of the CCS InfoCast, an official announcement system for an establishment, particularly in a school, that will erase all doubts about the validity and reliability of information that one is receiving. This will serve as an efficient and effective way to receive important announcements without delay. It is designed to send information to cell phones which is more convenient to both to the recipients and the senders. This will also help clear confusions during emergencies, update people about the future events and will make communication easier and faster which is necessary in real life.
Since we are under the reality that communication and technology are conjoined necessities of life, and since communication via different means like the social media are not generally reliable and timely, the researchers came up with the idea of making announcement and information dissemination possible without delay and with validity through an SMS-based announcement system that is controllable by the sender. This system project is particularly for the College of Computer Studies (CCS) of LSPU (Laguna State Polytechnic University) Sta. Cruz Campus which now certainly is in need of the said proposed technology.   
",Introduction
"Project Context
The technology at this moment has grown rapidly especially in the educational field. This time is the period of experimentation of innovative technologies. These technologies are commonly used in different aspects of industries to make jobs fast and easy. The use of modern technology helps in the development of industries and gives more idea to the people and for them to be aware of using a new innovative technology. The “CCS InfoCast: An Information Dissemination Management System using SMS Blast” offers CCS-LSPU Sta. Cruz Campus the ability to communicate with students via SMS text messaging.  From weather-related closings and schedule changes, to fundraising event reminders and rumor control, the uses of the system are endless. And because of this study, CCS can help the environment by going paperless. 
This messaging platform helps school administrators, the Dean, the Faculty members, and other authorized personnel in improving the emergency response time, reduces risk of miscommunication, meet mass communication challenges, and reach enough number of individuals effectively and efficiently. More importantly, School Announcement allows CCS to become proactive and communicative while improving safety, security and preparedness.

Population of the Study
The main respondents of this study were the client and employees of College of Computer Studies where the College of Computer Studies Information Kiosk would be to design and develop. The system would provide help and support among the CCS dean and instructor by providing relevant information. The respondents would evaluate and asses the proposed system by answering the questionnaires. The survey was made using stratified sampling technique wherein the proponents divide the entire population into different subgroups or strata.
",Method
"After the approval of the title proposal, the proponents had a brainstorming in order to get started with their study. During the brainstorming they had a discussion about the software and hardware that they were going to use, the information they needed to gather, and the things they needed to do in order to achieve their goal.
The proponents requested the approval of the Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa Cruz Campus College of Computer Studies in order to gather the significant data necessary to answer the objectives of their study.
The following instruments or tools were used by the proponents in gathering data for the study. The proponents used this as basis for drawing conclusions or making assumptions. Some of these instrument or tools are interviews, observations, internet research, library research, questionnaires and consultant.
Interview
The proponents conducted an interview in Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa Cruz Campus College of Computer Studies where they gather the data by asking questions to get the needed information’s from the interview.

Observation
Through observation of the current operating procedure gives the proponents additional perspective and better understanding of system procedures.
Internet Research
The internet provides the proponents instant information on most topics and layout about the head of their office. It enables the proponents to use and evaluate information as a tool in decision-making which are related to the proposed system by means of principles and functions.
Library Research
The library served as one of the main sources of information for the proposed study of the proponents. Some information came from books, previous studies, newspaper found in the Library of LSPU Santa Cruz Campus. To enhance their knowledge and understanding of their proposed study, the proponent’s related studies were also taken from the previous studies found in the library which the proponents find significant with their proposed study.
Questionnaires
Questionnaires were given to the respondents of the study in order to satisfy the proponent’s goal to get and measure the opinions, polls and attitude of the respondents towards the study.
Consultant
With the assistance of consultant the proponents learned and gained more ideas about the proposed study in how it would work as well as the components and devices that would be needed and used in building-up the proposed system and capable to recognize whether the project was feasible or not.
Sampling Techniques
The respondents of this study came from LSPU-SCC College of Computer Studies which is the main users of the proposed system. Because it was not possible to study an entire population of LSPU Santa Cruz Campus College of Computer Studies, a smaller sample was taken using purposive sampling technique. It is a type of sampling where the first available primary data source will be used for the research without additional requirements. The researchers use this sampling because there are so many student enrolled in college of computer studies in other words, this sampling method involves quick getting data for our respondents.

Statistical Treatment
The proponents used weighted mean to get the statistical treatment. The Likert scale is an attitude measurement used in research where in place of a numerical scale for answers. Answers were given on a scale ranging from complete agreement on one side to complete disagreement on the other side with no opinion in the middle. Weighted mean was used by the proponents to get the user acceptance of CCS InfoCast to its users.
