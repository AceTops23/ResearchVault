"Philippine education is strongly viewed as a pillar of national development and has a big impact on economic growth (Lim, 2018) and it is one of the important sectors of the government. Philippine education has been strongly shaken by the Covid-19 pandemic that brought a serious negative impact on the Education system UNICEF (2020). In response to this situation, the government adopts a new normal in education. The government implemented the Learning Continuity Plan for the school year 2020-2021. The aims are to give quality education for all, in accordance with the provision in the 1987 Philippine Constitution, Republic Act No. 9115 also known as Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001, on sec.2 the declaration of the policy stated that the state needs to promote and protect the right of all Filipino to quality basic education and make it accessible to all.
 Higher Institution uses instructional materials as a tool for teachers to sight the education process for effective instructional delivery and promotes learner’s academic achievement, Instructional Materials has a big role in student success as it can enhance the knowledge, problem-solving skills, and thinking of learner (Magulod, 2017) moreover, according to (Tiburcio, 2020) Instructional Materials is another channel of communication, used by teachers to deliver more vividly instructional information to students. The instructional materials must be aligned with all the elements of the course, including assessment, activities, and learning objectives to become effective. To facilitate meaningful learning, it is necessary to create and use quality but locally suited Instructional Materials in higher education. (Nicolas, 2020). In response to the new normal in education, The Government integrated SLMs as Instructional materials with the alternative learning delivery modalities to be offered for diverse types to ensure that all students have access to quality basic education.
  It is vital in any institution to plan how schools will be able to pursue its mission of implementing quality education in every student (Tria, 2020). To continue the advocacy of the government for quality education for all, those instructional materials need to be carefully selected, organized, and planned. A good and suitable evaluation method is required (Isa et. al, 2018), to assess the effectiveness of Instructional Materials of the institution in the learning process and improvement of the academic performance of the student (Caluza et al., 2017). 
 Evaluation is the best way to enhance service quality (Isa et. al, 2018), improving performance, productivity, and institution quality. To maintain the quality of education, Instructional Material should be evaluated to ensure that acceptable standards of education and resources for delivery are being maintained.
The Evaluation of Instructional Materials in Laguna State Polytechnic University are handled by CIDQA (Curriculum Instruction Development Quality Assurance Office), it is needed in order to control academic quality, monitor, and maintain the quality of lectures (Winarno, 2017). However, the department is having difficulty in monitoring the status or tracking the location of the Instructional Material that leads to prolonging the process of Evaluation, if the department has good monitoring, they can track who they need to alert about the delayed return of IMs. Because it is important to deliver the Instructional Materials to the student without delay as it is served as a guide for the student to understand the subject or course. The researcher proposed a system that helps the office to monitor the status or track the location of IMs to help enhance the process of Evaluation of Instructional Materials.
",Introduction
"CIDQA)Curriculum Instruction Development and Quality Assurance are responsible for maintaining quality in all programs at Laguna State Polytechnic University headed by Dr. Albert Yazon as Director and Mr. Enrico Rivano as Chairperson. To ensure that the quality of education is still in line with the program, the CIDQA need to evaluate Instructional Materials (Syllabus, Course Guide, and Self- paced Learning Module), as these Instructional Materials are important to promote individual and independent learning (Nardo, 2017).
 The process of evaluation of Instructional Materials in Laguna State Polytechnic University started in Aug. 2020 as a support to promote quality education in the new normal. The evaluation starts when Faculty members create Instructional Materials such as syllabus, course guide, and self-paced learning modules, those IMs will be sent to the deans of respective colleges/department, the dean will send it to the CIDQA office with the use of a different platform like messenger and google drive. Then the CIDQA office will send the IMs to University Cluster Curriculum Review Committee (UCCRC), after checking the IMs need to send back to the Faculty member for revision. After the instructor revises the IMs they will send it back to the deans and the dean will send it back to CIDQA, then it will be sent again to UCCRC to check if all the revision made was correct, if yes, it will be sent back to CIDQA, and it will be endorsed to CIDQA director and Vice President of Academic Affair (VPAA) for approval, after the approval it will send back to CIDQA, then back to the deans, and finally to the instructors, then the instructor can now distribute it to their student and it will serve as a guide of each student to understand the subject or course. However, in the interview with Mrs. Rachiel Rivano one of the members of the University Cluster Curriculum Review Committee (UCCRC) she stated that the CIDQA office is having difficulties because the return of IMs from evaluation and revision is taking too much time that leads to prolonging the process of evaluation, the office can't monitor or track the files so they don't have any idea which department are causing a delay in returning the IMs to CIDQA. This problem is causing the delay of approval of the IMs that leads to delay in the delivery of Instructional Materials to students. Through the help of the interview, the researcher identified some problems in the process of Evaluation of Instructional materials that this study aims to answer. 
With the development of information technology, in the field of education, the study will focus on answering the identified problem 1.) How to design and develop a system that has the ability to monitor the status of Instructional Materials by the use of File History log and Email Notification for (New IMs, Revised, Approved, For Revision) that can help the user to track the IMs status for a faster process of Evaluation. 2.) How to conduct a test on the developed system to assess the performance and effectiveness of the system based on the following functionalities as Account Registration, Creating and Submission of IMs, Updating/ Editing the IMs, Endorsement of IMs to CIDQA Chairperson, Endorsement of IMs to UCCRC for Checking / Evaluation, Evaluation /Checking of IMs, and Receiving and Approving IMs. 3.) How to evaluate the developed system to the future stakeholder user to determine its operational readiness and level acceptability in terms of Quality Factors, Perceive Ease of use, User Experience, Perceive in Usefulness, Attitude, Behavioral intention to Use.
",Method
"The Population of this study were from Laguna State Polytechnic University, which has experience and understanding in Creating, Submission, and knowledge about the process of Evaluation of Instructional Materials.  The researcher chose the respondent as those types of respondents can give accurate data as they have the knowledge and understanding in terms of Evaluation of Instructional Materials.Interview – An unstructured interview is an open situation through which greater flexibility and freedom are offered to both sides (i.e. interviewers and interviewees), is expected to broaden the scope of understanding investigated phenomena, as it is a more naturalistic and less structured data collection tool (Alshenqeeti, 2014).",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and the interpretation of the result of all the data gathered from the survey/evaluation conducted by the researcher to the respondent after the system was developed. Also, this chapter discusses how the researcher accomplished each objective of the study by the use of all data gathered.",Discussion
