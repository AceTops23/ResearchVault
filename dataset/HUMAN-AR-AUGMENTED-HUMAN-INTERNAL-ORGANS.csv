"The following were the result of the performance of the proposed system as perceived by the respondents in terms of system usability, functionality, reliability, maintainability, and portability. The data gathered from the respondents were analysed tabulated and interpreted to determine the status of the programming tool used in developing the system.in her study entitled ""5 reasons to use Augmented Reality in Education"", by 
integrating augmented reality into your lectures, you’ll capture the attention of your 
audience. You will have their undivided attention. For instance, a teacher in 
dentistry integrated Augment into his lessons to show 3D models of teeth and how 
the human jaw works. Students are able to access models on their own devices 
via Augment’s app. By viewing augmented models, the students can gain a better 
understanding of the concepts they are studying. This is a fun way to engage 
students and reinforce concepts they’ve seen during class lectures. Prototypes, 
physical models, and detailed illustrations and posters are all extremely expensive. 
More often than not, schools do not have enough money to buy all the 
supplementary learning materials they would like. Further, these learning 
materials get worn down, lose their relevance, and get misplaced over time. With
Augment, you do not have to invest in physical materials. Students can access 
models from any device at any time. Whether they are at home or in the 
classroom, your students can study and interact with the course materials. With a 
simple a scan, students can access augmented models representing anything from 
a part of the human anatomy to a famous monument to a molecule. Also, students 
can access websites directly from the Augment’s app. This experience creates a 
complete learning cycle. Your students will retain more knowledge for a longer 
period.
The researchers came up with this thesis project to provide learners an easy 
way of learning and understanding the Human System. It will also be more 
interactive for the learners having the chance to see 3D and realistic illustration ofthe Human System and not those images and text that can be seen in textbooks 
and other references. The researchers have also observed and experience the 
difficulty of using books with faded figures of the human system and unclear text 
description in the textbooks and references.",Introduction
"Rizal Standard Academy is located at Rizal Avenue Brgy. Poblacion II 
Nagcarlan Laguna. It currently has 178 students in the primary level, among this 
total number is 29 grade 4 students, 25 grade 5 students and 25 grade 6 students. 
Its current principal is Mrs. Florenda M. Dorado and they have 6 elementary 
teachers. They study human organs using the usual ways we can see in schools, 
they use the reliable books and other visual aids and sometimes show heavy, 
expensive and everyone gets the chance to use the model of the Human Internal 
Organ.
 The researchers, upon conducting interview with the client, have identified that 
the problem of not only the Rizal Standard Academy but is also a problem for many 
schools in the Philippines is the unclear illustrations of parts and organs of the 
Human Internal Organ that can be seen in textbooks, charts and other visual aids 
that causes students to have less interest in the topic and also the lack of the 
supply of Human Internal Organ that are more effective but is heavy and can be 
pricy to provide.",Method
"Population of the Study
Rizal Standard Academy offers Preparatory up to Senior High School Level, 
and all in all it has 774 students that is composed of 178 Elementary Students and 
596 High School Students. 
The study used only the grades 4-6 students of Rizal Standard Academy, 
which has a total of 29 grade 4 students, 25 grade 5 students and 25 grade 6 
students and use 6 teachers of the primary level and the principal of the school
that were essential for the study as they were the one who tried, assessed and 
evaluated the developed mobile application.
The researchers came up with this total number of respondents through 
purposively selecting all of the students of grade 4-6 to identify the level of 
performance in the whole population of the students. Through purposively 
selecting the respondents, the researchers would use all of the population of the 
grade 4 – 6 students for the study.
Data Collection Methods
For the development of the study entitled: “Human AR: Augmented Human 
Internal Organs” the researchers gathered the necessary data or information that
was added and would be the content of the mobile application. This part shows the 
methods that the researchers had performed to get the needed data.
Brainstorming
The researchers had collaborated their ideas or did the brainstorming 
method to propose a solution for the problem that the client had faced and also it was very helpful to the researchers to know what should be added to the mobile 
application to suit the needs of its users.
Interview
The researchers had conducted some interviews with different elementary 
schools to get the data that would be the content of the mobile application as well 
as other things that would be a basis for the development of the mobile application. 
The researchers had also conducted interviews with the students to find out their 
problem with the current way that they are taught in the topic of Human Internal 
Organs.
Internet Research
The researchers had used internet research which provides valued 
information that had become very beneficial for the researchers. Through the use 
of the internet, researchers had learned and found great ideas that helped in 
finalizing the title and features as well as other obtained studies that helped support 
the researcher’s study.
Library Research
The researchers had also used library research which had become 
instrumental for the researchers, as it became another medium that could be a 
source of data that could be added to the content of the system. The researcher 
had gone to the Laguna State Polytechnic University - Sta. Cruz Campus library 
as well as the College of Computer Studies Research laboratory in search for data  fits the topic of Human Internal Organs and as well as relevant books or other 
hardcopies of coding pamphlets that is use for the development of the system.
Observation
The researchers had also used the observation method which helped in 
getting additional information through just observing the surroundings and process 
of teaching Human Anatomy in different schools and also observing on their main 
problem with their current process of using books and other materials for teaching 
the topic Human Internal Organs.
Questionnaire
The researchers used questionnaires to get the feedback of users and also 
identify the needed information that would be essential for the researcher’s study. 
Furthermore, it was used for the testing period, where the researchers would test 
and assess the developed software with the use of Questionnaires.",Result
"This contains the insights on the developed mobile application. It lists down 
the needed Operational Feasibility, Technical Feasibility, Schedule Feasibility and 
Economic Feasibility which are needed to develop the Mobile Application. This 
also contains the Requirements Modelling, Object Modelling, Design of the Study.",Discussion
