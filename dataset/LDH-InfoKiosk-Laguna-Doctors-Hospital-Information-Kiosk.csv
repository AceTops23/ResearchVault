"Information Technology has provided humans a big leap for every task 
in terms of communications, production, entertainment, information 
dissemination and etc. As our worlds gets advanced, our technology is also 
becoming vast every day, enlarging capabilities of Information Technology to 
grow through-out other fields like medicines, constructions, healthcare etc. but 
more specifically providing essential Information to people. So, information 
and information technology could collide to provide educational knowledge to 
people, for example is an Information Kiosk, in which it is a very big help for 
people who needs specific information right away.
People tend to get lost and ask for directions but sometimes other 
people aren’t sure about the information they were giving and receiving.
Because of this type of problem people came up with the idea of an 
“Information Kiosk”, with the help of this technology, people can access 
information by themselves without having to ask other people the information 
they needed. Making it simple, Information Kiosk is an interactive system 
which contains information about a particular place with various types of data 
that can be access. 
Information Kiosk has been an accepted and available almost 
everywhere. Information from these are related and found in public places like 
schools, malls, government offices and even hospitals. Computer kiosks are 
the machinery of choice when it comes to delivering information and 
services to the public via an automated system. Even if you do not know 
much about self-service and information kiosks, you have probably have used 
them more than you think. A kiosk allows users to ask questions, get 
directions, search information, locate a house or job situation or perform an 
online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise.
Hospitals are now seeking ways to systematize processes through 
automating different hospital transactions processes like laboratories, billings, 
payments and other services which has been proven to make job easier and 
much efficient for the patients’ satisfaction. In the Philippines, information 
kiosk are also accessible in hospitals. It has been proven useful in locating 
units, rooms, identifying services or even setting an appointment to the 
physician. 
The researchers decided to conduct this particular study to provide the 
client an excellent service. This project allows the hospital to have an 
electronic helpdesk that would help out-patients and visitors. This electronic 
concierge through information kiosk will be strategically positioned in the 
hospital premises. The information kiosk can provide information such as 
directions, laboratory inquiries, physician schedule inquiries and setting 
physician appointment.
",Introduction
"Information is very significant. It is actually considered to be one of the 
most important resources of an organization. Technology is an essential tool in conveying or disseminating information all throughout the organization and 
public information.
Laguna Doctors Hospital (LDH) is located at Pedro Guevara Ave, 
Santa Cruz, Laguna. Currently, LDH has a hospital information help desk in 
which people can inquire and ask for queries. The information help desk has 
been utilized since the establishment of LDH. It has the advantage of 
personally talking to a person at the information desk which can assist a 
visitor throughout the process but its disadvantage is that the concierge 
usually is not available and no one is there to talk to or ask about his concern 
about certain transactions like for doctor’s schedule and others.
Based on the interview conducted by the researchers, it was found out 
that there is indeed a need for an information kiosk or an electronic helpdesk. 
The researchers intends to develop an automated and systematic information
dissemination for LDH which can reserve an appointment and checks the 
availability of the consultant. It can also navigate throughout the building with 
its mapping feature.
The current system of the Laguna Doctors Hospital is basically just 
approaching to the information desk and asking the information you needed. 
Then, it tells you where to go or where to find this person, so the aim is to turn 
the manual process to an automated and systematic information 
dissemination. 
With the concept of an Information Kiosk, the researchers came up 
with the idea of LDH-InfoKiosk (Laguna Doctors Hospital Information Kiosk) 
where it is not only containing information but the features of Mapping and 
OPD (Out Patient Department) Reservation with SMS (Short Message 
System) Notification. With the help of this LDH-InfoKiosk the intended clients 
or others who go to Laguna Doctors Hospital can freely access the 
information about the availability of the doctors / consultants or general 
information of the hospital they need to see. OPD patients can also make an 
appointment for the consultant they need to refer to by sending a message 
through the Kiosk to the secretary of the consultant for confirmation, and the 
mapping feature extends the capability of the Kiosk by having to roam around 
the whole building without moving. As and an addition, the researchers added
the queuing process in order for the patients get the most convenient service 
regarding the consultation time of their doctors.",Method
"Data Collection Method
After the approval of their title proposal, the researchers had a 
brainstorming in order to get started with their study. They discussed 
about the hardware and software needed also the information that they need 
to gather in their research.
The researchers requested the approval of the Laguna Doctors 
Hospital in order to gather the significant information necessary to answer 
the objectives of their study. They used instruments and tools in gathering
data. Some of these instruments and tools are interviews, library research, 
internet research, and questionnaires.Library Research
The researchers visited the library to have a detailed research and also 
to read different books and materials that are relevant to the study being 
conducted. The researchers uses this kind of method of researching in 
improvements that the proposed system could undergo. In this way, the 
proposed system could be improved compared to the previous ones.
Internet Research
The researchers conducted internet research through Google Scholars 
to gain additional information and to boost their knowledge and ideas about 
the system to be develop.
By this, they found some designs that can be implemented in the 
system and also some additional modules that need to be in the system.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interview with the hospital administrator 
of the Laguna Doctors Hospital, Mrs. Debbie Dael, who directs the 
administration office. The researchers ask questions about the history of the 
hospital, the problems that their encounter and the significant data that the 
researchers can add to their system.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire was prepared by the researchers to determine the 
acceptance of the respondents. The researchers used Technology 
Acceptance Model and assessed the respondents.",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests 
results acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also 
discusses if the study entitled Laguna Doctors Information Kiosk has satisfied 
and fulfilled the needs of its client.
The researchers used survey questionnaires for the testing of the 
system that used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). These were given to 
the hospital staff, visitors, and patients in the Laguna Doctors Hospital 
building. This was done to acquire the necessary data to determine the 
efficiency and the effectiveness of the system and ensure that if it has fulfilled 
the needs of the client.
Different questions were given to each category of users. The 
researchers using a five-point Likert scale on the survey questionnaires.
