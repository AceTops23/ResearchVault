"The evolution of Information Technology is fast progressive in many ways. From simple document transfer to biometrics technology, technology has been a game changer today. Biometrics Technology has been utilized for the past years. It has been used for security purposes like ID, password, and many more. It helps business men in making their business secured by using biometrics for their employees that is in the cashier position. Biometrics is also utilized in schools, offices and government facilities by using it to substitute logbooks for the attendance of the employees of such offices. Attendance is one of the most important thing for an employee because it will help them to identify their presence in the office. Logbooks are one of the most significant tool to record the attendance in their respective offices. It is widely used all over the world because it’s the universal attendance record system.
 System is an integrated set of interoperable elements, each with explicitly specified and bounded capabilities, working synergistically to perform value-added processing to enable a user to satisfy mission-oriented operational needs in a prescribed operating environment with a specified outcome and probability of success. Different kinds of system are developed to make our lives easier. One of this is the Management Information System (MIS). A Management Information System is an information system that uses the data collected by transaction processing system and uses this data to create reports in a way that managers can use it to make routine business decision  in  response  to  problems.  Some  of  the  reports   that  this  system

creates are summary, exception and improvised reports. All this is done to increase the efficiency of managerial activity. 
Improving the way of life has always been the goal of every researcher and by harnessing the full potential of technology, this could be achieved. The topic is “FAMS: Faculty Attendance Management System”. Notifies the user about the monitoring of the faculty members. The college dean’s secretary and faculty members of CCS will be the users of the system. With this system and the hardware that was used, the admin can monitor the instructor’s location and their attendance. Only those persons with access can see all the records. One of the blooming developments of technology that really helped in improving the life of every individual is the use of an Android Application. In some cases, some of the instructors have emergency meetings or other activities that was scheduled on their during class time. So they tend to give activities to the students. After, they will come back when the time given to the students are already finished. Thus, the researchers came up the idea to develop a “Faculty Attendance Management System” to monitor whether the instructors are inside the department or not through GPS.  
",Introduction
"Technology has grown rapidly especially in the security field. This time is the period of experimentation of innovative technologies. These technologies are commonly used in different aspects of industries to make jobs fast and easy. The use of modern technology helps in the development of  industries and  gives more  idea to the people and for them to be  aware of 

using a new innovative technology. Technology continued to develop a new release and as part of it the Attendance Management System.
Biometrics technology is one of the most widely used device for attendance of employees. It varies in many body parts with a unique structure like finger print, hand geometry, iris, and voice recognition. One of this is the fingerprint scanner where you could place your index finger to determine who you are by analyzing your finger print, based on your identity. It can also identify if you are authorized in different levels of access.
The researchers aimed to develop a Faculty Attendance Management System that will improve the department’s attendance and other related concerns about this field. This study will provide a new way of recording the attendance of the said department. The unreliable use of logbook is one of the main concerns of the researchers because it is not accurate and is alterable. It can also be accessed by an unauthorized person in which the record can be changed. The proposed system replaced this process with an efficient and faster method. The data of faculty members is accurate and quickly delivered. Through this study, the college dean’s secretary can definitely benefit in which the attendance records will be safe and easy to retrieve.
",Method
"The researchers obtained a deeper analysis on what are the problems that they have encounter during the research, designing and data gathering process. 
For them to be able to gather information needed in the study, the following methods were applied:
Internet Research. Internet helped the researchers in discussing the different aspects of the proposed system. It enables the evaluation of the hardware, idea, and some possible solutions in problems encountered in the study. The internet also gave other information by providing other studies or citations that in which it supports the system by means of function and principle. 
Library Research. The researchers visited the library to have detailed research and also to read different books and materials that are relevant to the study being conducted.
Interview. The researchers conducted an unstructured interview to gather information needed to the system. In this method, the researchers knew how the existing system will suppose to work.
Consultant.  With  the  help  of  a  consultant  and  some  IT  Experts,  the researchers  learned  and  acquired  ideas  about  the study.  The  software  and  hardware  devices  that  are  needed  are  also  discussed  to  


be  able  for  the  researchers  to  know  how  each  of  them  works  and  how  can  it  help  the  system  to  be  functional  and  reliable. 
Questionnaire. The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaires to evaluate the different criterion of the system in terms of quality factor, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, security, experience and actual use.
",Result
This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if the study entitled FAMS: Faculty Attendance Management System has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client.,Discussion
