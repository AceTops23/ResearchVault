"Today in the modernized world, many changes have happened not only in the increase population but the continuous innovation when it comes to technologies. In the past decades, technology had grown rapidly that cause an increase in the number of use within schools and universities for the purpose of education and automation. One of which is computer it is one of the most used technologies nowadays. Everyday technology goes more advanced and greater which means establishment have to adjust with what the technology offers. Technology is significant in everyone's life because it lets people improve the way they live so that they can preserve their own personal energy and focus on more important factors in life. 
Computer is one of the most used kind of technology today because of the various ways it can be used. Computers are now considered non-paying members of the staff, it can make reduce the human effort, it can be an entertainment, and also can reduce complexity. They can do things that man can do without sacrificing consistency and availability just by learning some knowledge about computers. Instead of having more people to work on a certain job, companies invest their money on computers. Companies have found out that when they have less people to facilitate, they can *have more computers to do the work for them. With this innovative idea, technology pushes the people to embrace the modern aspect of technology, thus forcing education to offer computer-based education.  

Safety and security system is a major problem in companies, business and establishment and even in the educational facilities. The difference of the two, security and safety, is an added emphasis on being protected on dangers that originates from outside. Any action of an individual that trespasses in the condition of protection by any physical means is a violation of security and safety. 
Every school has a hesitation to enter a visitor that is not purposely into their establishment. Therefore, it is difficult for them to easily accept a visitor they need to check if they really have to enter the school and it is a lot of work for them. They will definitely waste a lot of time if they are going to entertain every visitor specifically if they have a lot of work to do. Therefore, it is important to have an efficient system that will make them work easier and aside from that they can monitor every visitor that is entering the school premises.
There are many ways in having a safety and security school in an easy way. By the use of an automated safety and security people will assure that they are safe and secured in entering the school as well as the employees and student. The researchers focus on how to lessen the work of the employees in safest and easier way. How to build a system that will make them feel safe and secured. And in this world, the majority of the establishment, companies and government still needed an automated technology, and one of this is the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus. 
The study is about the establishment, employees and student as well as the visitor. The study is “Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, 

Campus Safety and Security Management System Using Barcode and SMS Technology”. It is designed automatically to monitor every visitor that is entering the school and to have an efficient and automated system. 
",Introduction
"The researchers observed that the daily monitoring of the visitors scenario in the entrance gate of the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus and they have found out that due to the large number of the visitors that didn’t log in in the entrance gate of the school, it is hard for the employees and security guard to accommodate all of the student needs so the researchers decided to develop a system that will provide the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus a faster way of monitoring the visitors inside the campus. The system equip the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus specifically the visitors and the establishment with the automated monitoring of the safetyness and security of the school, checking the attendance and behavior of each security guard and monitoring of the information of the visitor. In terms of checking the visitor needs and the visitors purpose, the employee and security guard needs to consume much of time to be able to check the needs to every visitor. There are times that the security guard can’t focus on the visitors because of the student’s rants in the security guard.
 During the phase one of the study the researchers had an idea in improving the effectiveness of the security in the school. To gather some information needed, the researchers conducted an interview and did some 

internet researcher. In order to accomplish the study the researchers listed the following questions: (1) how to provide LSPU with a computerized visitors monitoring device that more effective and efficient. (2) how to develop a system that will help safety and security management office to easily monitor visitor who didn’t log in (3) how to develop a system that the department and faculties will be notified if there are incoming visitor. 
 Obtaining the questions in phase one, the researchers developed the “Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus Safety and Security Management System using Barcode and SMS Technology” where in the user can print the visitors pass and monitor the time in and time out of the visitors. In order to prove that the developed system was effective it requires in answering the following questions: (1) how to test the developed system in LSPU Main Campus? (2) how to assess the acceptance of users in using the developed system? (3) how to improve the developed system based on the recommendation of the intended users?
",Method
"Data Collection Methods
 These are the tools used by the researchers in gathering data and information in Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus, interview, observation and research.
Interview
The researchers interviewed one of the employees, the researchers asked how and what is the flow in accepting a visitors. Then the researchers give questionnaires indicated the history, background, personnel and also the process inside the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus. 
Observation
 The researchers observed how the system flows and who are involved in the operation of accepting a visitors. The researchers observed the process of the teachers checking the guard’s attendance, monitoring of the visitors information.
Research
The researchers researched through libraries reading unpublished thesis digging related studies and literatures about the present study. The internet is another method used by the proponent, with the used of internet, the 

researchers browse articles related to the present study. The researchers’ research focuses on what technique can be added or replace in the monitoring to have an accurate and efficient result. After the research about the securing and monitoring system, they research about technology that they think that can help the securing and monitoring a system which is the barcode device. 
",Result
"This section, discuss the analysis and interpretation of the test results as well as the observations on the limits of the system’s capability.
The researchers discussed the “Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz, Campus Safety and Security Management System Using Barcode and SMS Technology” it was developed by the researchers with the purpose for the benefit of visitors of the said university. To test if the study reaches its objective and functionality of the system, the researchers distributed questionnaire to the respondents of the system. Results were analyzed and interpreted. 
The following charts discuss the result acquired from the survey conducted with each user assigned for the use of the system. The following data were computed, analyzed and interpreted to come up with the result if the developed system has satisfied the users. The figure below is the result of the evaluation.
