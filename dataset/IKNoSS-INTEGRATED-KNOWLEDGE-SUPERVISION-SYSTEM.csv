"In the current time, people cannot visualize their life without technology. 
Surrounding the world various technologies help people to live their life with 
more luxury. Online systems are helping people to make lesser mistakes. 
These are working accurately and a user just need to program them with proper 
information and all work gets done perfectly.
The researchers knows that, Learning Management System (LMS) is 
a software application for the administration, documentation, communication, 
reporting and delivery of electronic educational technology (also called e learning) courses or training programs. LMS range from systems for managing 
training and educational records to software for distributing online or 
blended/hybrid college courses over the Internet with features for online 
collaboration. Colleges, universities and schools use LMS to deliver online 
courses and augment on-campus courses. LMS also act to augment the 
lessons the teacher is giving in a brick and mortar environment, not just replace 
them. Corporate training departments use LMS to deliver online training, as well 
as to automate record-keeping and employee registration. As the title of the 
said study of the proposed title a Learning Management System is a web-based 
application that allows educational institutions and companies to provide the 
target beneficiaries with informational content and educational resources. It is 
an effective and responsive way for industry experts and teachers to create, 
deliver, and manage their content, as well as monitor participation and assess 
performance among learners.
An LMS is a software application or Web-based technology used to plan, 
implement, and assess a specific learning process. Typically, An LMS provides 
an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student 
participation, and assess student performance. An LMS may also provide 
students with the ability to use interactive features such as threaded 
discussions and discussion forums.
Since technology is leveraged for learning purposes, students and 
teachers interact with each other via online forums and threaded discussions. 
These tools serve several functions including course documentation, 
administration, and evaluation that allow both the teachers and students to 
maximize the use of LMS. With this study, the system offered a solution from 
problems encountered by the student and teacher in their past activities. It 
simplifies the learning process and procedures to make it more responsive to 
both student and teachers.",Introduction
"Manual systems put stress on people to be accurate in all details of their 
work at all times. The problem being that people are not perfect, yet much each 
of us wishes we were. With manual systems, the level of service is dependent 
on individuals and this puts a requirement on management to run training 
continuously for staff to keep them motivated and to ensure they are following 
the correct procedures. It can be all too easy to accidentally switch details and 
end up with inconsistency in data entry or in hand written orders. This has the 
effect of not only causing problems with customer service but also makes
information unable be used for reporting or finding trends with data 
discovery. Reporting and checking those data is robust can be timely and 
expensive. This is often an area where significant money can be saved by 
automation. The Developers of iKno’SS: Integrated Knowledge Supervision 
System offers a different variety of features that can help the society in most 
useful ways.
In a way of having an LMS. The study starts by having an advance 
study in academic subjects that lets the students have a preview about the 
upcoming lessons of their teacher. For the student to be ahead in development, 
knowledge and progress. The system also let those students who missed and 
was absent for a very long time to catch up to their lesson through assignments 
of the teacher in the specific lesson that they missed. And lastly, the students 
can personalize his account by uploading files, video and audio, that makes 
learning fun, interactive and collaborative that they can surely enjoy.
The developers from Laguna State Polytechnic University, College of 
Computer Study seek to resolve feasible problems that a student encounters in 
studying. Having an overview to the said problems, a school only has a limited 
access of information and data. Through a self-made system that the 
researchers made it a remedy could be given and an aid to those students in 
need of special lesson. The old manual system of Magdalena National High 
School requires the teachers to give exams and quizzes to the student which 
may cause noise. The teachers are sometimes to focused in reading the 
questions so that the students would have an opportunity to cheat. The 
researchers made a study to resolve these problems that the students of 
Magdalena National High School encounters. Having an overview of different 
problems, which includes the school having a limited access of information of 
data, and having unorganized files for submitting assignments teachers would 
tend to ask students to pass it is social media sites which make it hard from 
them to download it one by one and check it manually. With the help of iKnoss: 
Integrated Knowledge Supervision System it could provide a locker for the 
students to save their unfinished work and for a formal sending of assignment 
or files an easier and more organize way. Another problem is that some of the 
students could miss their lessons and having no handouts could have a student 
miss a topic and be late to the discussion it would be hard for the students to 
ask to their classmates to know the topic taught by their teachers. With the help 
of iKno’SS: Integrated Knowledge Supervision System it could provide a 
handout for the students by downloading files in easier and fastest way even 
they missed the lesson. It could also help the students in advance reading for 
the next topic to be discussed by the teachers.
In the first phase of the study, the researchers considered the problems 
encountered by the clients which became the basis for the development of the 
system itself. The researchers verified the most suitable programming tools in 
developing the system as well as the research methodologies used which is the 
ADDIE Methodology. The ADDIE Model is a framework that lists generic 
processes that instructional designers and training developers use. It 
represents a descriptive guideline for building effective training and 
performance support tools in five phases. Analysis. Design. Development, 
Implement and Evaluation. At the middle of the project, it will still retain its value 
and be able to provide a sense of structure to the whole program. Addie has 
very useful having stages clearly define which makes implementation of 
effectively as needed to develop the system.
",Method
"Popukation of the StudyThe respondents of the study were taken from Magdalena Integrated 
National High School involving the Principal, the ICT coordinator, the Teachers 
and the Students. All of these participants were selected through Purposive 
Sampling. This sampling method was conducted where there was a specific
population sample. A survey questionnaire in Likert format was given to the 
respondents.
The respondent of the study from Magdalena Integrated National High 
School where chosen using the purposive sampling method and it occurs when 
elements selected for the sample are chosen by the judgment of the researcher. 
Researchers often believe that they can obtain a representative sample by 
using a sound judgment.
Data Collection Method
In data collecting the researchers are looking for the best reliable 
information that we considered as the most helpful in conducting a research. 
These are the method used in getting some useful information:
Internet Research 
It is the most source of information and the most reliable source of 
knowledge. It is the most useful and convenient field of research, because of 
the huge information that can be found in the internet.Interview
The researchers gathered information and insights from other who are 
currently involved in the topic, the researchers conducted are interview to the 
client’s workplace.
Proficient Consultant
The researchers consult in IT expert for possible advance and upgrade 
of the proposed system by giving expert opinion, experience and suggestion 
about some features and module of the proposed system.
Observation
The researchers undergo an observation before starting the propose 
system to identify each specific problem encountered by the MINHS and to 
know what is the best tools needed to ease their problem.
