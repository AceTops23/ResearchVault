"The Administration Office of the Municipality of Sta. Cruz are responsible for 
managing the scholarship program headed by Mr. Richmond Javier. The Municipality 
of Sta. Cruz started the scholarship program in order to help the students to pay to pay 
for their school fees in exchange of collecting residual waste. The program was 
specifically designed to help the students living and studying in Sta. Cruz Laguna.
The process of the scholarship program is based upon the residual waste that 
the scholars submit in conjunction to the recycling efforts of the municipality. First 
they need to file an application for the program then the admin office will give them 
the form to be filled upon by the student. Upon completing the application form the 
students will then pass the supplemental documents like barangay indigency, copy of 
grades, barangay clearance and copy of registration form from the school that they are 
attending in order for them to prove that they are eligible for the said program is 
exclusive only for citizens of Sta. Cruz Municipality. After this Sir Richmond Javier 
of the admin office will check the documents that the aspiring students had submitted 
for verification. If the student is qualified for the program then sir Richmond Javier 
will post an announcement on Facebook the list of accepted applicants in the program 
In order for the scholar to get their scholarship grant he or she needs to submit the 
required weight of residual waste that the program requires in their designated 
schedule Every barangay in Sta. Cruz Laguna has a schedule of submission of the said 
residual waste and once the requirements have been met then the admin will post an 
announcement on their official Facebook page and thru sms that their scholarship 
grants are ready for releasing per schedule. In claiming the scholarship fund the 
scholar needs to present their sedula to the releasing officer in charge. 
The problem with the current process is that the admin office only saves the 
data in index cards for filing in the cabinet. There is no proper way of storing the data 
of the scholar’s hence it’s hard to monitor the data. It is also hard when scholar’s 
needs to update their information thus contributing to longer processing time. Through 
the interview the researchers were able to identify some problems in the process of 
monitoring the scholars, their residual waste and informing them on the upcoming 
events",Method
"Population of the Study
The researchers conducted an interview with the administrator staff of 
Municipality of Sta. Cruz, Laguna. Currently there are two administrative staff in the 
administration office. During the interview the researchers found out that there are 
1,600 students who are currently registered in the scholarship program of the said 
municipality. These students are from the schools, colleges and universities within the 
land coverage of Sta. Cruz, Laguna and these students will be the respondents in this 
study.
To get the right respondents, the researchers consulted their statistician and 
came up with 320 student’s respondents. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the 
respondents has been reduced to 100 students and two administrative staff with the 
total of 102 respondents.Data Collection Instrument
Data collection is a process of collecting information from all the relevant 
sources to find answers to the research problem, test the hypothesis and evaluate the 
outcomes.
According to Barrett & Twycross (2018) in a study entitled ""Data collection in 
qualitative research"" stated collecting data through interviews with the participants is
the effective ways to gather information. Interviews give the most direct and 
straightforward approach to gathering detailed and rich data regarding a particular 
phenomenon. First thing that the researchers have done is to interview the client in 
order to collect various information to know the specification that will be included in 
the system. Also the researchers also apply different kind of approach to gather data 
like interview, consultation, library research and online research.Interview
Interviewing is an important method of data collection method and plays an 
important role in many research studies, especially where data on 
experiences or beliefs is needed as define by Hunn et al. (2000) in a research study 
“Using Interviews in a Research Project”. The researchers conducted a face to face 
interview at February 7 2020 (2:43PM) and February 12, 2019 (01:24 PM) with theadmin staff, Mr. Richmond Javier, to be able to identify the major problems they had 
encountered in their current state in handling the scholar’s documents.
Consultation
Consultation is the process of getting advice from an expert or other person 
with a master degree or higher. This enables consultants to determine solutions that 
are applicable and effective. Qualified consultants combine years of experience with 
real-life lessons learned in situations similar to the challenges you may be facing as 
mentioned by Erchul & Sheridan (2009) in their study “Research in School 
Consultation”. The researchers consulted their adviser and system specialist in order 
to get opinion, advice and suggestion to help the research in completing their study 
with wanted outcomes and to further improves study itself. 
Library Research
Library research collects materials for use in intensive research projects. 
According to Shrestha (2008) in a study entitled “""A study on student’s use of library 
resources and self-efficacy"" stated that library is an important part of any academic 
institution, it is a universe of knowledge for acquiring or providing information and 
sources made available in various format. The purpose of the researchers in 
conducting library research is to find a similar studies as reference and to gather 
additional information that can help in their study. 
Online Research 
Online research is a method that involves collecting information from the 
internet. According to Hooley et al. (2012) in a research entitled “What is Online 
Research?” stated online research are a great option for researchers who would like toconduct their own research. They are less time consuming, they are cheaper and you 
get the results faster. The researchers utilized the web for research purpose to upgrade 
and improve the advocates' learning in the investigation. The web gives a major guide 
to the researchers for the explanation that it gives thoughts to structuring, making 
codes in building up the framework, and to look for some related writing and studies.
Survey and Questionnaires
Survey research is a commonly-used method of collecting information about a 
population of interest. The population may be composed of a group of individuals or 
organization. According to West (2019) in an article entitled ""Data Collection"" Data 
can be collected from a large number of respondents. In general, the larger the number 
of respondents the more accurate will be the information that is derived from the 
survey. The researchers prepare a series of question to produce a questionnaire. To 
conduct a survey using google forms the researchers prepare and distribute the 
questionnaire throughout social media platform.",Result
"This chapter contains detailed presentation and discussion of data analysis and 
the results based on the objectives of the study. The researchers discussed the 
“Municipality of Sta. Cruz Scholarship Program Validation” with the purpose to 
improve according to the user’s needs.
