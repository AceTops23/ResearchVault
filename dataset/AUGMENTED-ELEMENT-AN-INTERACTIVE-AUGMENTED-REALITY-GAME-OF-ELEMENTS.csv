"Millennials are also referred to as Generation Y’s, are those born after 
1982, they are quite a contrast from their baby boomer parents and early 
Generation X. (Strauss, 1993). Previous studies have explained the unique 
characteristics of millennial students. Millennials are the new generation of 
learners and the first generation to grow up with technology integrated into 
their lives--cellphones, i-Pads, computers, the Internet, instant messaging, 
texting, MySpace and Facebook accounts, computer and console video 
games and multimedia (Nikirk, 2009). These individuals are said to be the 
contributor of the future of technological advances. In addition to this, 
educational revolution has evolved to meet the needs of the millennial 
students. All of these advanced technologies greatly affects the learning 
process of the new generation today, and in return, their utmost potential 
serves as their guide and stepping stone in improving the way of living which 
is the key to a bright future.
Game studies and mobile technologies has become a fast-growing 
field in research. The interest of teachers and educational scientists in 
innovative technology for learning and teaching has grown over the years. 
According to Chan & Ahern (1999), when people are intrinsically motivated to 
learn, they not actually learn more, they also tend to have a more
positive experience in life. Games meet both these tests for effective learning 
environments: they are active experiences, and they have the capacity to 
provide intrinsic motivation. Computer technology and video game 
environment has provided a new educational landscape injecting appropriate 
theoretical concepts to a more enjoyable learning experience. As new 
technologies enable increasingly sophisticated game experiences, the 
potential for the integration of games and learning becomes ever more 
significant.",Introduction
"Education is the most powerful weapon that a person can have. Every 
person or individual must have an education in a way that they can use it for 
future time. In achieving this learning, one should go to school or some type of 
learning organization. In schools, they will just give the traditional type of 
education which is referred as a long-established customs found in schools 
that society has traditionally deemed appropriate. In the Philippines the mostcommon type of traditional education is the visual aids and the oral recitation. 
In a typical approach, students sit quietly on their places and listen to one 
student after another to recite his or her lesson, until each had been called up. 
While for part of teachers, they use cartolina, manila paper or some other 
means of displaying the lesson in front of the class. Unlike today, there are 
many applications that you can use for learning process; one of which are
examples is the educational games.
Educational games constitute a major field inside the serious games 
ecosystem, attempting to educate the players, while entertaining them. 
Augmented Reality (AR) is the one that increases gameplay and potentially 
produce unique educational affordances. According to Erric Soerri (2012) on 
his book entitled, “The periodic table: Its story and its significance”, it is 
difficult to understand the classification of elements without first attempting to 
understand what an element is. Also, According to the survey that the 
proponents gathered, the first reason why many people find it difficult to study
is because of having no interest especially when it is an ordinary periodic 
table. It ought of that, the proponents offered a solution that answers this kind 
of problem.",Method
