"People are always aware of the never ending evolution in technology. 
Devices are getting more sophisticated and advanced. End users are always 
following the current trend in the field of communication. Computer trends 
have become more powerful in this current world today. Advanced technology 
nowadays have helped people’s communication become easier. The current 
state of technology which is a visual technology has evolved for the years. It 
has been greatly used in businesses, education and companies. It helps in 
disseminating information quickly and more reliable.
Various types of programmable announcement and reminder systems 
have been developed to disseminate information. Examples include store 
announcement systems which use recorded announcements to inform 
customers of special sale events and other promotions (in some cases by 
interrupting background music that is normally played over store 
loudspeakers), and personal reminder systems which play recorded 
messages to remind the user of important dates or obligations.
Announcement is very important because everyone should have the 
knowledge about what is going to happen for them to be informed and for 
them to be ready. To make an announcement, they use paper and pen 
otherwise, they only announce verbally. 
To improve the way of life has always been the goal of every
researcher. In harnessing the full potential of technology, this could be 
achieved. By spreading a particular information throughout a specific area or building fast and easy. We are in the era where technology in which both 
computers and mobile phone, has an SMS feature when utilized is a great 
tool in disseminating information. Traditionally, notice boards, verbal 
broadcast and other traditional announcement were used. Since, the college
should be the one leading the university when it comes to innovation and 
technology, modernization in terms of updates and instant communications is
really an essential. Hence, the researchers came up with the idea of latest 
technology and innovation, that is very beneficial not just in the field of 
communication, but also for educational purposes.",Introduction
"Visual communication is a way in which ideas and information are 
delivered in forms that can be read or looked upon visually. This kind of 
technology can provide a faster and easier way of transferring information. 
For example, faculty members can make a great use of this kind of 
information by making their announcements or information easier to 
understand by people through the use of pictures. 
The researchers aimed to develop a CCS-eBASS: College of 
Computer Studies- electronic Bulletin Announcement System using SMS that 
can definitely improve campus announcements and other concerns related 
within school and students. The study provided a new way in posting 
announcements or messages in the school premises. Information from 
instructors to students is accurate and delivered quickly. Updating the 
students for a new announcement is also done thru this system.
The researchers are able to formulate a common objective which is to 
develop and test “CCS-eBASS” College of Computer Studies – electronic 
Bulletin Announcement System using SMS” that help the College of Computer 
Studies, Faculty Members, Students, Parents and the College Dean. In line 
with this, specific research questions were formulated to aid with the
development of study:1) Identifying the corresponding software application 
and suitable database for CCS-eBASS. 2) Analyzing the suitable interfaces to 
be created in the system. 
The study then proceeds to its second phase which aims to know the 
acceptability of the developed system entitled CCS- eBASS: College of 
Computer Studies – electronic Bulletin Announcement System using SMS to 
the user which is the Associate Dean of CCS, LSPU-SCC. It contains the 
objectives identified from the previous phase of the study. At this point the 
researchers acknowledged the general problem, how to validate the 
effectiveness of the developed CCS-eBASS, specifically, the researchers 
wanted to answer the following research questions: (1) how to test the 
functional requirements of the developed system? (2) how to assess the 
behavioral intention of the users in the developed system? (3) how to 
determine the cost analysis for the deployment of the system?",Method
"The following instruments were used by the researchers in order to 
make the study feasible. The researchers used materials such as 
books,manuscripts, thesis and previous related studies to help make the 
study feasible. The internet also made a big contribution in providing sufficient 
data needed by the researchers.
Internet Research 
 The use of the computer and internet helped the researchers in 
discussing the different aspects of the system. It enables the evaluation of the 
hardware and all the materials needed in the study. It provides additional 
ideas in the development of the system. The internet also supplied information 
by providing other study in which it supports the system by means of function 
and principle. The world wide web helped the researchers to accomplish the 
supporting documents for the creation of the study. 
Library Research
The library is one of the main sources of information for the 
researchers in gathering information. The researchers read previous studies 
in the library to help them in terms of related data which are essential in 
building theories in developing the system. The information gathered from the 
related readings helped in building the supporting documents for the system.
The researchers gathered information from the library of AMA 
Computer College Santa Cruz & STI College Santa Cruz.
Consultant
With the help of a consultant, Mr. Jeen Paul Estremera, the 
researchers learned and acquired more ideas about the study. The 
components and devices that are needed are also discussed to be able for 
the researchers to know how each of them works. Coding examples for the 
system are also taken up.",Result
"On this section, it discusses the analysis and interpretation of the test 
results as well as the observations on the limits of the system’s capability.
The researchers have survey questionnaires for the acceptance of the 
technology used using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). These were 
given to the students and faculty members of Laguna State Polytechnic 
University. This was done to acquire the necessary data to determine the 
efficiency and the effectiveness of the system and ensure that it has fulfilled 
the needs of the client.
To assess the behavioral intention of the users the researchers 
adapted the questionnaire of Khan and Iyer (2009). The researchers used the 
different factors, for the acceptability of the student and faculty members. 
The following chart discuss the result acquired from the survey 
conducted to each user assigned for the use of the system. The following data 
were computed, analyze and interpreted to come up with the result if the 
developed system has satisfied the users. The figure below is the result of the 
evaluation.
