"Technology can be defined in many ways and most of the time it is 
defined as an application of knowledge on certain things to invent machines or 
any equipment to make work easier. Technology today is applied on most of 
the business establishments and medical sectors or even on schools in order 
to make their business reliable, fast and systematic. One of the medical sectors
that technology can be applied is the dental clinic, patients need good quality 
of medical service because dental patients has one of the most sensitive case 
like patients in hospitals. 
Some dental clinics are included on hospitals or health centers. Dental 
clinics included on government hospitals or health center has a come and go 
process that doesn’t need scheduling unlike with private clinics. Most of the 
dental clinics today are still using manual process. They are using individual 
cards for writing the patient’s profile and dental records. For scheduling, the 
secretary of the dentist will arrange the cards chronologically on the dentist’s 
table according to their time schedule. After the patient’s consultation with the 
dentist, the doctor will record the treatment done with the patient. This process 
is time consuming for the doctor instead of getting the next patient inside the 
treatment area so some of the clinics today preferred to use the computerized 
system which is the dental management system.
A Dental Clinic Management system promotes easy data entry and 
usage. It includes patient’s personal information, medical, and dental history, 
treatment plan, case reports and statistics that promotes a paperless office. It provides easy access of the data in advanced and ordered fashion. The system 
maintains patient’s record and securing it from any possible risks.
It is easy to search and retrieve the information stored, related to 
patients. Previous medical records are used to manage documents of patients 
visited earlier.
This study aims to design a Dental Clinic Management System with SMS 
Notification for efficient and effectiveness of the clinic. The study intends to 
replace the manual processing of records in the clinic in terms of giving their 
client a good quality of service. The primary purpose of this study is to help the 
clinic in giving their clients a faster way of transaction process.
",Introduction
"Today, population is increasing in numbers and patients that needs 
health care attention raised. It makes patient’s health care record physical 
condition and location become extremely important.
One of the dental clinics today that still uses manual process is the 
Feliciano Dental Clinic in Sta. Cruz, Laguna. Manual process can cause loss of 
productivity and unreliable record keeping. Searches for misfiled charts waste 
time. One of the major concern of Feliciano Dental Clinic is the lack of security 
of the data. Without security, data can be prone from numerous risks including 
data theft. This problem can affect the patient’s record that is only written in a 
card and the integrity of the patient’s care. There are limitations to the physical 
quality of the paper record. The paper is fragile and does not last permanently. 
Normal use of the record may result torn or stained documents. Also, over the 
years, the ink used to complete documentation can fade. Actual damage 
resulting from water or fire is another threat to the physical integrity of the paper 
record. This can result in incomplete or inaccurate healthcare data collection. 
Handwritten information may be illegible that can prone for errors in patient 
treatment or medical orders.
When it comes to inventory management, the Feliciano Dental Clinic is 
using manual process that makes their inventory system ineffective. It wastes 
time when the patient are keep on coming back for the item that the dentist 
cannot provide at the day and time of the patient’s appointment. Patient’s 
appointment of the Dental Clinic is through first come, first serve basis. It 
depends if the patient calls for appointment through calling the clinic ahead of 
time. Then the clinic assistant arranges the information card chronologically on 
the dentist table. If the patient did not come on time, the treatment of patients 
is delayed or if the patient did not come at all. The schedule that was arranged 
chronologically are not followed because being uninformed. To resolve these 
problems, the researchers planned to develop an appropriate system which is 
the Feliciano Dental Clinic Management System with SMS Notification that can 
replace the manual process of Feliciano Dental Clinic.
The Feliciano Dental Clinic Management System with SMS Notification 
will help the user to avoid these problems. With the use of fact finding 
techniques, the developers are able to identify the problems and formulate a 
common objective which is to develop and implement “Feliciano Dental Clinic 
Management System with SMS Notification” that will help the dentists and the 
clinic assistant in making their work easier and accurate in data.
",Method
"The researchers obtained a deeper analysis on what are the problems 
that they have encounter during the research, designing and data gathering 
process. 
For them to be able to gather information needed in the study, the 
following methods were applied:Library Research
Researches were done in LSPU – Sta. Cruz Campus Library in order to 
gather essential information and related projects about Management System, 
some information were gathered from past documentation of the past students 
of LSPU- Sta. Cruz Campus.
Internet Research
The researchers also conducted some internet research to acquire some 
related information to understand their studies and to know their techniques 
and sample design of their system. The developers found sample designs and 
interfaces that are related to the developed system. Also, they found different 
components that are included to it.
Client Interview
The researchers interviewed their client to ask necessary information 
about the process of the Feliciano Dental Clinic to learn and analyze what 
should be included in the system and how they will enhance it. The developers 
conducted the interview with the one who assist the clinic secretary, Abigail Del 
Valle. The interviewers then learned and became knowledgeable about the 
clinic method which then used for analysis and further enhancement of the 
clinic’s current system.
Consultant
With the support of a consultant and some IT Experts, the researchers 
gained more ideas about the created study. The software needed and hardware 
devices that are needed are also discussed to be able for the researchers to 
know how each of them works and how can it helps the created system to be functional and reliable. After collecting relevant information using different data 
gathering procedures, the researchers classified the possible advantages of the 
different users and possible beneficiaries of the system.
Questionnaire
Questionnaires were prepared by the researchers to determine the 
acceptance of the respondents. The respondents need to answer the questions 
based on the following criteria: Quality Factors, Perceived of Ease of Use
(PEOU), Experience, and Perceived in Usefulness, Attitude, Behavioral 
Intention, and Actual Use which follows the Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM)",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if 
the study entitled Feliciano Dental Clinic Management System with SMS 
Notification has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client.",Discussion
