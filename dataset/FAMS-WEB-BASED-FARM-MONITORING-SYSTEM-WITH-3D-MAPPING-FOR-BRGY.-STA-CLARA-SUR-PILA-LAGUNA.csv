"As technology grows and develop, creative innovations also grow. These changes make people’s lives easier and more convenient. As a result different emerging technology are being developed to ease the task and lessen the time of how people and do their everyday lives. 
Technology has become one of the most important elements in today’s societies and its role in our lives keeps getting complex, Technology takes different forms and nowadays people provides various description about it and a majority of these are dependent on what or how it has been effective in one’s job. Technology has played a big role in developing the agricultural industry. 
Today it is possible to grow crops in a desert by use of agricultural biotechnology. With this technology, plants have been engineered to survive in drought conditions. Through genetic engineering scientists have managed to introduce traits into existing genes with a goal of making crops resistant to droughts and pests. 
Today’s technology can provide easier access to the farm and crops with greater opportunities to gather data. Monitoring systems are commonplace in many areas of industry; nowadays monitoring of farm crops, managing data and the generating of reports are easier by using computer systems. However farms as a general rule are a minority for this statistic. Web based applications have evolved significantly over recent years and with improvements in security and technology there are plenty of scenarios where traditional software based applications and systems could be improved by migrating them to a web based application. 
Web based applications have come a long way and now offer competitive advantages to traditional software based systems allowing businesses to consolidate and streamline their systems and processes and reduce costs. With the use of technology in today’s world we should not develop technology because of itself, but to develop it, because it adds value to society and simplifies human life. 
Technology is an essential part of our lives today and few can imagine living without. We achieved a lot with the help of technology that shape our world, better than ever before, more convenient to everyone using computer. 
Modern farms and agricultural operations work far differently than those a few decades ago, primarily because of advancements in technology, including sensors, devices, machines, and information technology. 
Today’s agriculture routinely uses sophisticated technologies such as robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, and GPS technology. These advanced devices and precision agriculture and robotic systems allow businesses to be more profitable, efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly.
",Introduction
"The technology we have today are upgrading almost every month. This is the time of experimentation of innovative technologies. The use of modern technology the manual process of monitoring of farm in Barangay Sta. Clara sur, Pila Laguna can improve to an automated system that can use easier and fast and replace the old process their system. 
In 1993 Municipal agriculture office function was on the National office but the Municipal agriculture office decided to turnover of all employees and personnel’s in the Municipal agriculture. they don’t had a project on that time, because all projects are in the Government, later on in the year of 2004 – 2005 Municipal agriculture office had a new project that passed on the National agriculture, at the year of 2010 they started to establish the Department of Agriculture.
The proponents developed a system called “FAMS: Web- Based Farm Monitoring System With 3D mapping for Barangay Sta. Clara sur of Pila Laguna” a web based system that can monitored the farm in Barangay Sta. Clara sur. 
The system could be use for monitoring and also generating reports that the client needs. The Department Agriculture of Pila monitors all the list of the farmers, farms and the crops by having weekly and monthly visit on different farmers in Sta. Clara sur Pila, Laguna. Through visiting them, Department Agriculture of Pila gathers data from time to time to have accurate information for reports that they send to the regional office and national office. This includes the harvesting and planting reports and damage assessment report. Currently, the Department Agriculture of Pila uses manual system which requires a staff to manually encode all the data needed. All data are stored in a computer using Microsoft Excel and Word. 
They are having a hard time in retrieving and updating the list of the farmers and it takes them too much time to create their reports, especially the damage assessment report which must be done quickly. There are still problems in monitoring in Barangay Sta. Clara sur in Pila Laguna. The Client needs are monitored manually the farm and also write and storing reports manually that cause a lot of time consumption. 
",Method
"Population of the Study
The researchers coordinated with the employees of Department Agriculture of Pila, Laguna. They are the main beneficiaries of the proposed system called “FAMS:  Web-based farm monitoring system with 3D mapping for barangay Sta Clara sur Pila Laguna”. 
The researchers conducted a pre-assessment survey to identify the usability, accuracy and effectiveness of their current system and if the system would help them. The respondents of the study were the technicians of Department Agriculture of Pila, Laguna.
The chosen respondents are knowledgeable about the flaws and weaknesses of the current system. 
Data Collection Method
 The researchers gathered data through the use of interviews, observations and survey questionnaires to have an exact and accurate data.
• Library Research
The proponents did research in library. In order to conceptualize a project idea, proponents needed to read literatures and thesis books about different studies with regard to technology and I.T. projects. The information the proponents got from researching in the library may be references and guide in conducting study and writing thesis.
• Internet Research
Internet Research is reliable for the proponents in researching project ideas and technology. By Internet Research, the proponents are able to cite articles about the study being conducted. Also via internet, the proponents may get ways and guides in developing “FAMS:  Web-based farm monitoring system with 3D mapping for barangay Sta Clara sur Pila Laguna”
• Interview
The proponents conducted an interview to collect data about the business of the client. By the use of the data collected by the proponents found out problems regarding the current system of the business and came up with solutions. Through consistent communication and interview with the client, the proponents know data collected by the client that will help support and be further proof for the study. 
",Result
"The following were the result of the performance of the proposed system as perceived by the respondents in terms of system usability, functionality, reliability, maintainability, and portability. The data gathered from the respondents were analysed tabulated and interpreted to determine the status of the programming tool used in developing the system.",Discussion
