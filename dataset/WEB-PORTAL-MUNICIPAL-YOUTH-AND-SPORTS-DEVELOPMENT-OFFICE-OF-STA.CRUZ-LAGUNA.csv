"Nowadays, most of the people rely on modern technology in terms of 
studying, communication, entertainment, and so on. Technology brings us much 
greater comfort in living than these past few years and we all know that technology is 
even more innovating. In other words, technology is evolving too fast that is has 
become where most people rely on doing their tasks. Spreading and collecting 
information by physical contact with other people is the most .common way that 
people used traditionally. Likewise, in the office of the Municipal Youth and Sports 
Development (MYSDO) is an organization that manages all the activities for the 
youth and adult in the municipality of Sta. Cruz, Laguna. The main process of the 
office was to serve the 26 barangay’s regarding in activities that covers up in sports, 
health and education of the residence of the said municipality. But due of not having a 
proper system or database the office encountered difficulty in managing and storing 
all the collected information.
In their current problem that they facing in their process are lacking of 
personnel to distribute and process the collected data or information, due of not 
having a data base all the collected information is stored in a record book. The 
centralization of the management should be implemented and is very important in 
every organization like MYSDO because most of the decisions of organization come 
from the management system and through the use of the proposed system the manual 
process of the office can be solve.
That is the problem that MYSDO facing nowadays, so the researchers find a 
way to lessen the problem of spreading wrong information and create a system that 
can manage correctly the information through the right use of technology like a 
computer that our community has today that only takes a short period of time.
