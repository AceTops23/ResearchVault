"Nowadays, technology is everywhere making it a big demand in the industry. Technology is very important and can be useful in many ways, like minimizing the time of people using the technology and making the result are being of any task happen in a short period of time. The computer technologies are all around us and used every day because it helps a lot in terms of service that the people need. Technology was really rising and it was on its fast phase. Impossible things in the past can now be real and that was because of the fast growing technologies and innovations around the world. 
Over the past years a lot of companies are relying on automated systems that were locally available. When the online systems were become available, many local systems converted into online systems. Online systems were ever growing on the past years. The reason of it was the database can easily be retrieved anywhere and anytime as long as the user is connected online. Reliability, accessibility, ease of use and consumption of time becomes lesser when using an online system.
With the use of automated payroll system, the data is more likely to be accurate rather than with the use of a manual process. For example, using an automated system on the payroll in an office to easily check and monitor the people on time without checking individually can be faster as compared to the traditional way. The information is well managed by using the automated payroll system. The importance of using these tools includes the improvement of the quality of service, fast process and precise information.
The main problem of the School Director of TESDA School Division is cannot always monitor the trainer and employee because of the location. The TESDA School Division Payroll and Management System will help to monitor and check them easily. The TESDA School Division Payroll and Management System can keep the record can show the records of the employee and trainer. The system can add, edit, and delete the record. The system will also compute the exact amount of the salary base on the time that will time check of the employee and trainer including the deduction of the late. The reason of it was the database can easily be retrieved anywhere and anytime as long as you are connected online. Reliability, accessibility, ease of use and consumption of time becomes lesser when using an online system.
",Introduction
"A system that has an automated approach is rapidly growing in terms of technologies. It helps businesses to enhance their manual systems and make it more reliable, fast and efficient. But despite the technology, the TESDA School Division are using a manual payroll system.
TESDA School Division started in 1994 there are three branches, five schools and a head office with a total of 20 employees and 30 trainers in different branches. The school director of TESDA was the one who monitor the attendance of all the employees and trainers in the different branches; the attendance was the basis for the salary computation.
The main problem of the School director was the location of the different branches, monitoring of attendance cause a lot of travelling time for the school director. Based on the above problem the researchers came up with an idea of creating an automated system that can lessen the traveling time of the School director in monitoring the attendance of the employees and trainers.
The first phase of study aimed: (a) to identify the problem encountered by the school director in monitoring the daily time record of the employees and trainers, (b) to create an automated system that eliminate the traditional way of creating the payroll in TESDA School Division, and lastly (c) to identify the benefits acquired for using an automated system.
The second phase of the study involves the following research question: (a) What evaluation tool can be used to assess the created system? (b) How to test the functionality of the system using the planned testing activities? (c) How to create an implementation plan to determine the different strategy for implementing of the developed system?
",Method
"All studies needs reliable information and data to ensure that all the facts and knowledge to keep the legitimacy of information intact. The researchers use different methods in collecting the necessary data that the system needed. The researcher conduct informal interview to the finance manager and school administrator of TESDA School Division, to be able to  understand the different problem that they encounter using the traditional way of processing payroll of employee. The following are the other method use by the researcher in collecting the data for the system. 


Internet Research
 The researchers used the Internet since it has a vast and limitless collection of knowledge from various people who have expertise in specific fields. Millions of studies, thesis, researches and articles are always available on the Internet. The researchers use the method to collect different related literatures and studies for the improvement of the study. 
Questionnaire
 The researchers used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaires to evaluate the different criterion of the system in terms of quality factor, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, security, experience and actual use.
Observation
 The researcher also conducted observation to see the flow of creating payroll for the employee of TESDA School Division. And also to observe the different problem that they encounter while using the current method.
Library research
The researchers conducted research in the library and looked for the related literature and studies that would help in creating the system. The library makes such information available and ready. The studies stored in the library can provide all the necessary guides that the researchers needed throughout the study of the research and the development of the system.
",Result
"It discusses the presentation, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The data are presented in accordance with the statement of the problem. ",Discussion
