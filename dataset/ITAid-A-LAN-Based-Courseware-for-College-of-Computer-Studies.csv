"The advent of computer-based information technologies, especially on the emphasis upon process, system and code has enabled business models and processes to perceive that they, too, function as forms or subsets of Information Technology (IT). Today, everyone has begun to write computer programs to aid their business processes, even small medium businesses. 
Educational Technology (ET) is the efficient organization of any learning system adapting or adopting methods, processes, and products to serve identified educational goals. This involves systematic identification of the goals of education, recognition of the diversity of learners’ needs; the contexts in which learning would took place, and the range of provisions needed for each of these.
ET research always had an ambitious agenda. Sometimes it only aimed at increased efficiency or effectiveness of current practise, but frequently it aimed at pedagogical change. While it can be considered as a design science, it also be addressed as a fundamental issue of learning, teaching and social organization and therefore makes use of the full range of modern social science and life sciences methodology.
Technology provides us with powerful tools to try out different designs, so that instead of theories of education, we may begin to develop a science of education. But it cannot be an analytic science like physics or psychology; rather it must be a design science more like aeronautics or artificial 
intelligence. For example, in aeronautics the goal is to elucidate how different 

designs contribute to lift, drag maneuverability, etc. Similarly, a design science of education must determine how different designs of learning environments contribute to learning, cooperation, motivation, etc.
Educational technologists would not therefore consider the computer as just another piece of equipment. If ET is concerned with thinking carefully about teaching and learning, then a computer has a contribution to make irrespective of its use as a means of implementation for the design of computer-based learning environments gives us a new perspective on the nature of teaching and learning and indeed on general educational objectives.
At the present dynamic education, the education system is being transformed to create a new generation of students who can adapt with the new technologies and are able to access and manage the information explosion. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a tool to revolutionize learning, to produce richer curricula, to enhance pedagogies, to lead to more effective organizational structures in schools, to produce stronger links between schools and society and to empower learners. 
A courseware is software intended to train or instruct a student based on a course. A courseware system is the combination of course content and a courseware. Courseware systems development is a complex activity. It is more than instructional design; it involves not just the learner and the instructor, but also the organization offering the course and the developer providing necessary software technology.
",Introduction
"The researchers created an effective courseware tool which entitled “ITAid: A LAN Based Courseware for College of Computer Studies”. The first phase of the study aimed to design and develop an educational technology solution by creating a LAN Based Courseware that can enhance teaching, learning process of students and equip the instructors in monitoring of the student’s activity. Specifically, it aimed to (1) identify the functional requirements of a user-intuitive courseware intended for the freshmen students, (2) determine the appropriate development tools for the modules and applications to be used for designing the courseware and, (3) formulate a procedure and guidelines for the implementation of the courseware. After the researchers formulated and accomplished the objectives, they identified the functional requirements that need the following: (a) a LAN Based software for the study (b) researchers conduct some research literatures, interviews to develop a courseware provided the student and instructor educational technology (c) lastly the researchers found out that the Addie Model is the perfect equal for the development of the LAN based courseware.
The second phase of the study entitled “ITAid: A LAN Based Courseware” focuses to evaluate effectiveness and accuracy of the developed system. Specifically, it required to answer the following question: (a) how to test the system functionality by the intended users? (b) how to consider the acceptability and performance of the user in emerging the
developed system?  (c) how to develop an implementation plan for the full deployment of the LAN based courseware for CCS?
",Method
"The researchers would explore a deeper analysis about the problems that they’ve encounter during the research, designing, and data gathering process. In order to gather the information needed for the study, the following methods were applied: 
First, Library Research is used by the researchers to make the study feasible. The researchers used libraries within the University and also other Universities. They gathered information used to conduct this study. 
Internet Research is used by the researchers to make the study feasible. The researchers used the computer to browse the internet. They gathered information to be used in the system. Some items needed for the system has also been found in the internet. The internet has been a great help for the searching process needed for the building of hardware and the creating of codes.
Interview is used by the researchers to make the study feasible. It is also conducted to gather information needed for the system flow. In this method, the researchers distinguished how the system would work. It was used to investigate and gather specific information needed.
The Consultant helped the researchers for the development of the system. The consultants gave generous amount of their time and knowledge in guidance to the students. The consultant would give ideas to the researchers in developing the system. The design of the system would be suggested by the consultant and he would help the researchers in the coding of the system. 
With the help of the consultant, the researchers analyzed and built the system easily.
",Result
"It discusses the presentation, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The data are presented in accordance with the statement of the problem. 
The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the survey questionnaire for the instructors and students of the Laguna State Polytechnic University. This presents the result to acquire the necessary data to determine if it achieved the usefulness and the effectiveness of the system.
There are different types of questions given to each category of the users. The researchers used a five-point likert scale on the survey questionnaires.
