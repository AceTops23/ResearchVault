"As our world is advancing in technology through the years, every 
organization is also upgrading the process of how they handle and finish their 
specific tasks with the use of new technologies at the schools, offices, 
hospitals, and everywhere. But somehow, other organization are still using the 
manual method which people are used to, because of that, they consume a 
lot time to finish a single activity. 
Nowadays, people live in the modernized world. Modernization is now 
a big part of the industry, economy and even in education. One way of 
showing modernization is by digitalization. Digitalizing is art of converting the 
contents of a document from a hard copy into a machine-readable format. It 
makes the materials easy to access and available electronically. It also serves 
a purpose of preserving the materials or any type of information that can be 
presented in digital forms such as pictures, music works, text, computer 
program, databases, models and design, video programs and other works 
combining many types of information. A person that is in need of information 
can easily click, type and search for the information needed in just a matter of 
seconds. It does not only makes searching and information gathering easy but 
also it saves a lot of time and effort not only for student and teacher but for 
everyone who needs it. ",Introduction
"Computer technology allows electronic portfolios (e-portfolios) to be a 
one career tool for life-long learners in today's workplace. Hard copy portfolios 
are being replaced by electronic portfolios, which are easier to manage and 
share with others. It is also portable, customizable and allows easy access 
control. The ability to capture and store non-traditional items like video files, 
audio files, computer programs, hyperlinked documents and multi-dimensional 
representations affords a more complete assessment of student learning and 
personal growth.
Student e-portfolio has been utilized and implemented in educational 
institutions in fact, electronic portfolio is very known in different universities not 
only here in the country but also in universities internationally. Some example 
of international university that uses e-portfolio is the Salt Lake Community 
College where they require all their students to create their own electronic 
portfolio as their reference and student progress. In fact, universities here in
the Philippines adapted the idea of electronic portfolio such as the Far 
Eastern University (FEU), as they defined electronic portfolio as a huge 
advantage unlike a paper-based portfolio, electronic portfolio allows the 
learners to enhance and monitor their progress in academic. 
Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) Main Campus is located in 
Santa Cruz, Laguna has been aiming for a good quality management. The 
developers believed that to be able to achieve quality management, LSPU 
must automate certain processes. In response with this goal, the developers 
intended to create a system entitled “ASADO: Automated Student File and 
Document Organizer”. This is an automated system that solves the problems 
in handling the compilation and storage of student portfolio. This system is 
useful to every student, instructors, and the College Administrators.
In particular, the College of Computer Studies (CCS) in Sta.Cruz 
Campus compiled the student’s school papers such as quizzes, seatwork’s, 
exams, assignments and projects through folders and file cabinet. Based on 
the interview conducted during the preliminary investigation to students and 
instructors in the department, the developers found out that most of the 
student’s activities, exams, assignment and quizzes are kept inside their 
bags. Portfolios are sometimes thrown in the garbage bin and after the 
student submitted their documents such as exam papers, quizzes, seatwork’s, 
activities and projects it’s just being placed on the table at the faculty roomthat occupies a lot of space and had the tendency that the professors might 
throw it away.",Method
"These are the methods that were used in conducting the research 
study. For gathering of data, the developers made an unstructured interview 
with the people who used the laboratory. The developers also used 
observation and other materials such as books, manuscripts, thesis and 
previous related studies to gather information that was needed. The 
developers also had a consultation to the teachers to know the hardware that 
will needed to develop this research study. These are reliable sources that are 
full of information to make the study become feasible. Another way to gather 
information is the internet; this also made a big contribution in providing 
sufficient data needed by the developers.

",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test result, 
along with the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discuss if the 
system entitled “ASADO: Automated Student File and Document Organizer” 
has fulfilled the needs of its client.
The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the 
survey questioner for the Administrator, Instructors and student of the College 
of Computer Studies. This was done to acquire the necessary data to 
determine the usefulness and the effectiveness of the system.
There are the different types of questions were given to each category 
of the users. ",Discussion
