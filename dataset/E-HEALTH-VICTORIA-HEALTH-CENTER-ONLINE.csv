"In today’s modern age where computer has become a way of life, it is 
evident that a majority of the country’s institutions still do not adapt the high 
technology. Particularly in most medical clinic facilities, daily clinic transactions 
are still done on paper. We all know that modern clinics are now operating at 
great step striving to serve as many patients as possible with the best of their 
abilities. But as the years rolled by, the number of patients has grown and 
various medical cases arise that the manual method of managing patient’s 
record, prescriptions, billing and appointment schedule, is no longer practical. 
In this study, we hope to develop a web-based application that will minimize all 
paper works and manual records keeping, therefore allowing doctors and staff 
ease in keeping track of patients, reducing patients’ waiting time and increasing 
the number of patients served – a system that is fully automated, user- friendly, 
time effective and efficient.
Patients records and disease pattern documentation is concerned with 
documentation of information obtained from patients and their particular health 
system in order to function properly if this information is not documented 
perfectly causing some data to get misplaced, the health system will not be 
efficient.
We all know that technology is the best and easy way to communicate 
with each other. So we decided to use our research thru SMS, because almost 
all of peoples use cellphone.According Jantz (2001) the emergence of the computer based 
information system has changed the world a great deal, both large and small 
system have adopted the new methodology by use of personal computer; to 
fulfill several roles in the production of information therefore computerizing the 
documentation of patient record to enable easier manipulation of the input 
process and output will bring us to this existing new world of information system.
Now more than ever, people have become more health conscious and 
are taking necessary steps to ensure that they have a sound body and mind 
that is why everyday many people come to clinics or health facility for check ups and treatments. A medical clinic is primarily devoted to the diagnosis and 
care of patients. Basically, patients spend a substantial amount of time in clinics 
waiting for services to be delivered by the doctor or health professional. The 
degree to which the patients are satisfied with the care received is relative not 
only to the doctors’ expertise in their field, but also to the quality of the clinic 
management. And we all know that as the number of patients continually 
increasingly difficult, especially if everything is done manually.",Introduction
"The developed project is intended to create a website called “E-Health: 
Victoria Health Center Online Information System Using SMS Notification”, a 
system that shows the important records of the patient. This online system 
would be useful for the health centers of Victoria, Laguna. This current process of the Victoria, Laguna health center involves the 
manual recording of the patient’s information. So the nurses who are recording 
the health records of the patients are encountering the loss of patients’ record, 
because they have shifting schedules for the first shift they have the record of 
the patients and tends to store it or place where second shift have the difficulties 
to find where are the files, because the records have been scattered.
The study intends to lessen the work for nurses and doctors, to keep 
their files for future use, with the help of “E-Health Online Information System 
of Victoria, Laguna.” Furthermore the study aims to answer these problems. (1) 
What are the main problems they have encountered by the patients of the 
health center? (2) What are the difficulties do the health personnel in checking 
all the information of the patient in health center. (3) How effective is the 
developed system in securing the information of the health center.",Method
"In this section it includes the important contents such as some 
information that researchers gathered. The following technique and tools were 
used by the researchers in gathering data for the study. The researchers used 
this as a basis pattern for drawing a conclusion. Some of these technique and 
tools are interview, observation, internet research, library research, 
questionnaires and consultant.
Interview
The proponents conducted an interview on each barangay of Victoria, 
Laguna to gather data by giving them a questionnaire to our needed 
information.
Observation
Through observation of the current operating procedure gives the 
proponents additional perspective and better understanding of the system 
procedures.Internet Research
The proponents also conducted some data research and other 
information using the internet. For collecting some useful data’s for developing 
our system.
Library Research
The researchers visited some library to have some source of information and 
knowledge by reading different books related to the study being conducted.
Questionnaires
The questionnaires were given to the health center resident nurses to 
survey some information’s that are needed to help create the system.
Consultant 
With the assistance of consultant, the proponents learned and gained 
more ideas about the proposed study in how will work as well as the devices 
would be needed and used in building-up the proposed system. ",Result
"This chapter discusses in details the results of the evaluation of 
analyzing the data, data collection method, sample size and sampling method 
and the number of respondents.
To attain the primary data or data gained from a primary variable, the 
researchers conducted an informal interview and surveys from the given 
variables:
