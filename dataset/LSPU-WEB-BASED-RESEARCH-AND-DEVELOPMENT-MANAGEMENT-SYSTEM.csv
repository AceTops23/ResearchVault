"As the years goes by, the technology has grown and become popular, 
most of the people in the business industry turn their manual process into 
computerized and even small businesses or organization are using automated 
system. Living in a modern world, our lives are made easier through the use of 
technology. The ability to keep in touch with family, business associates, and 
have access to email is just a few reasons why we rely on our digital devices. 
The technological advancement is making a lot of difference in our lives. This 
advancement requires the use of computers which influenced and changed the 
society. Computer is concerned on how to benefit the people because it is made 
to simplify the work and minimize the time needed to accomplish a certain task. 
In the field of education, research papers are important mostly in professors and 
student to propose the freshly ideas about different topics to benefits the 
University.
Research and Development is an emerging field within University 
Management which focuses on a practical, cost effective and sustainable 
approach to getting research into use and also Research and Development is 
part of a university which the fresh ideas of the faculty researchers proposed and 
being approved by the Heads/Members of the Research and Development 
Office. The fresh ideas of the faculty researchers can help for the changes of the 
university. It aimed to ensure reliable verification of results, and permits new and 
innovative research built on existing information. And it is concern about the 
research transactions of a university; it is the process such as submission and 
approvals of research and development proposals, and making research report.
Since the University is the main source of knowledge, the researcher 
thinks of developing a web based system “LSPU Web Based Research and 
Development Management System” for the submissions and approvals of the 
research proposals of the faculty and other researchers which they can upload 
the proposals and they can download the important documents, print the reports 
that they need and also view the daily announcement regarding the activities that 
the Research and Development Office will announce. The Research and 
Development members are the one who will handle the system. The Faculty 
Researcher, RIU, Chairperson and R&D Director will be the users. By this, it is 
truly important to have an accurate web based system which serves as a tool to 
become their process easier.",Introduction
"Computer technology allows web based system to be one of the tools for 
today’s workplace. Hard copy documents may be misplaced in one place. 
Somehow, manual process is being replaced by electronic and automated 
nowadays, which are easier to manage. Web based system is a big help in every 
organizations like companies, hospitals and schools. In particular, LSPU 
campuses may take a lot of time in the process of submissions and approvals of 
the research and development proposals. Research and Development Offices 
handling a lot of research proposals because of that there’s a possibility that the 
documents are tend to be gone or lost.
Laguna State Polytechnic University was started on 1952, and it was 
composed of four (4) campuses, LSPU Siniloan, LSPU San Pablo, LSPU Los 
Baños, and LSPU Santa Cruz Main Campus. Laguna State Polytechnic 
University is aiming in a good quality management. The researchers believed 
that to achieved good quality management, the certain processes must convert 
into automated. In response with this goal; the researchers came up to create a 
system entitled “LSPU Web Based Research and Development Management 
System”. This is a web based system that solves the problems in the manual 
submissions and approvals of the research and development office of LSPU.
Research and Development Office (R&D Office) of Laguna State 
Polytechnic University focuses on the R&D transactions like submission, 
approvals and reports. Various problems have been identified through series of 
interviews gathered by the researchers. The researchers came up with the idea 
of developing a web based system for the Research and Development Offices of 
LSPU because all the campuses of LSPU are currently using a manual process 
in the submission and approvals of research proposals. There are disadvantages 
because of their current manual process it includes time consuming, delayed 
papers because of manual submission, get lot of works because of scattered 
papers in one place. The web based system contains information of the users, 
research proposals, and the summary of reports. The study expects not to 
alteration the current process of the submissions and approvals of the Research 
and Development instead it aims to improve the current process by developing 
this study.
",Method
"Population Of The Study-The study has conducted at Research and Development Office to see if 
the proposed system was necessary for them to use. The R&D Director, R&D 
Chairpersons, LSPU Dean/RUI and LSPU Faculty were the respondents for the 
study.Data Collection Method
To make the study successful, the researchers used the different methods 
in collecting data such as reading previous thesis in a library, surfing through 
internet for some information that related to the study and get some related 
literature and studies. The researchers conducted interview to the Research and 
Development office to get the information needed. Data collection method is important to the study since the information that gathered take effect on the 
conduction of the study.
Library Research – The researchers used the library to gather some study
needed to the research. The researchers get related studies and literature to 
prove that the researcher’s research is possible. Also the researchers used 
library for the research since there are lot of thesis, journals and books that can 
help to the researchers for the further research and also it will become guidelines 
in the study.
Internet Research – The researchers used the internet to search some Software 
Methodology that is appropriate to the study. The researchers search the 
appropriate sampling method that might use in the research, and also the 
researchers used internet to get some related study and literature for further 
explanation to the study. 
Interview– The researchers gathered an interview together with the client to get 
some information needed in the study. The researchers use actual interview to 
the client for better explanation to their manual process. The researchers also 
conducted an interview with the R&D Director and R&D Vice President to know 
more about the process of submitting the faculty research proposal. Having data 
gathering through actual helped the researchers to acknowledge the situation of 
the client.",Result
"In this section, the researchers represent the software in terms of the 
acceptance by the R&D Director, R&D Chairperson, RIU college coordinators 
and the faculty. The researchers came up with the software evaluation form 
which consists of the criteria such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, 
maintainability and portability.
The researchers determined the information requirements, gathered 
interpretations, defined the system requirements, built prototypes for discovery of 
requirements, prioritized and analysed the system needs. After the survey was 
conducted, the data gathered was statistically treated, tabulated and analysed 
according to the specific problems of the research. There were seventeen (17) 
questions in the evaluation form. These were presented to show the result of the 
information. The R&D Director, R&D Chairpersons, RIU college coordinators and 
the faculty will be the users of the system.",Discussion
