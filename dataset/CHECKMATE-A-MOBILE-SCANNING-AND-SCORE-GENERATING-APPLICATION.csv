"Technology is an essential part of the lives today and few can imagine 
living without. They achieved a lot with the help of technology that shape the 
world, better than ever before, more convenient to everyone using computer 
and mobile devices such as they can be in touch with those they need to 
reach, whether work-related or personal in nature and not the least of which is 
making communications routine. 
In today’s world with the use of technology it adds value to society and 
simplifies human life. One of the benefits of this is that they use to solve 
problems or achieve a goal about using a mobile device. With the use of an 
android mobile application that may help users to efficient and more 
conveniently process. 
Mobile application commonly referred as application, are considered to 
be one of the fastest growing trends in Information System industry (Eddy, 
2011). Users enjoy the variety of features that mobile apps can provide 
quickly and without introducing unnecessary complexity into their designs. As 
a result, mobile apps present a more popular interface for interaction with 
business systems than using web application via web browser.
Educational software and applications have grown more adaptive
relying on technology and algorithms to determine not only what a student 
knows, but what his or her learning process is, and even his or her emotional 
state. For all the technological progress, though, implementation remains a major challenge. Schools and educators across the country continue to 
wrestle with the changing role of teachers, how to balance flexible and 
“personalized” models with the state and federal accountability requirements 
they still must meet, and the deeper cultural challenge of changing educators’ 
long-standing habits and routines. Despite the massive investments that many 
school systems are making, the evidence that digital personalized learning 
can improve student outcomes or narrow achievement gaps at scale remains 
scattered, at best. Benjamin Herold (2015).",Introduction
"In particular, computers and mobile devices have become, such an 
integral part of society that technology has become a relied-on tool for most 
people. With the use of technology we can easily accessible the information 
and conveniently. The researchers planned is to develop a mobile android 
application that may help to lessen the manual task of checking and 
computing test result of the test paper.
The first phase of the study aimed to design and developed a 
Checkmate: A Mobile Scanning and score generating application for College 
of Computer Studies in LSPU Main Campus using LAN Based System that 
can scanned the answer sheet of the test paper using android scanning 
application. Specifically, it aims (1) to identify the functional requirements of 
the Checkmate: A Mobile scanning and score generating application (2) to 
recognize the requirements if confirms for the development of the Checkmate: 
A Mobile scanning and score generating application (3) To determine the appropriate development tool for the study. After the researchers formulated
and accomplished the objectives. It identifies that the functional requirements 
need.
The research is on its second phase which aimed to validate the 
effectively and efficiency of the developed mobile application. Specifically 
sough to address the following questions: (a) How to evaluate the 
acceptability of the system using Extended Technology acceptance Model. (b) 
How to develop a testing plan to test the function of the proposed android 
application. (c) How to develop an Implementation Plan for the proposal.
",Method
"In data collecting the researchers are looking for the best reliable 
information that we considered as the most helpful in conducting a research. 
These are the method used in getting some useful information:
Library Research
Researches were done in LSPU – Sta. Cruz Campus Library and AMA 
– Sta. Cruz Campus in order to gather essential information and related 
projects about Scanning android Application, some information were gathered 
from past documentation of the past students of LSPU- Sta. Cruz Campus 
and AMA –Sta. Cruz Campus
Internet Research
The researchers also conducted some internet research to acquire 
some related information to understand their studies and to know their 
techniques and sample design of their system. The researchers found sample 
designs and interfaces that are related to the developed system. Also, they 
found different components that are included to it. 
Expert Consultant
The researchers consult in IT expert for possible advance and upgrade 
of the proposed system by giving expert opinion, experience and suggestion 
about some features and module of the proposed system.
Observation
The researchers undergo an observation before starting the developed 
system to identify each specific problem encountered by the LSPU- CCS and 
CTE Department and to know what the best tools needed to ease their 
problem.
nterview
The researchers gathered information and insights from other who are 
currently involved in the topic, the researchers conducted are interview to the 
client’s workplace.",Result
"The Content of this chapter illustrated the descriptive analysis and 
interpretation of the results gathered during the application evaluation. The 
assessment made by the researchers was formulation of a survey form for the 
respondents of “Checkmate: A Mobile Scanning and Score Generating 
Application” a five points likert scale method was used for the improvement, 
validity and the importance of the current study. Different categories, SA Strongly Agree, A- Agree, N- Neutral, D- Disagree, VD- Very disagree, were 
made for the respondents: a total of 20 teachers of Laguna State Polytechnic 
University, were asked to answer the survey together with their comments 
and suggestions if possible. There are eight criteria given by the researchers: 
Quality Factor, Perceive in Usefulness, Perceive ease of use, Attitude toward
Usage, task technology Compatibility, Experience, Behavioral Intention and 
Use of Technology, which pointed the strongest and the weakest points of the 
application. The result gathered made the system better and efficient.
