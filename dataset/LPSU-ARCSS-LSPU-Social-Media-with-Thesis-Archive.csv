"The Internet had always provided a way of communicating and accessing 
information that would’ve been near impossible in the past. With the help of the 
Internet, countless data can now be skimmed through search engines. The Internet 
also provided a digital place for like-minded people to communicate and share their 
interests or passion. With the help of the Internet, communicating has never been 
better. Instant messages and e-mails has become the standard norm in reaching 
out to the different people in distant countries and places. Among all types of 
communication in the digital world, nothing tops the ever popular social media. The 
rise of famous social media like Facebook, Google+ and Twitter pave way for 
people to be updated in the daily lives of their friends, family, and celebrities or 
even meet strangers in such platforms. 
The process of research and thesis topic searching process has been a 
burden and problem to undergraduate students, specifically millennials. The 
availability of research materials is not easily accessible in the internet, oftentimes 
only the abstract version is found. While the library can help to find the necessary 
materials, the hassle of going from one place to another can be time and money 
consuming for undergraduate students. Most libraries also have strict rules and 
regulation regarding the borrowing or reading the research materials that students 
can access. Students can’t take the research topics they find and bring it out of the 
library for further use. Some libraries strictly forbids taking pictures or photocopies 
of materials. Even if students somehow manage to
secretly take pictures, there are dozens of pages from each research topic that 
can frustrate students. The same can be said if students shall write down the 
information. The current method of gathering materials presents different problems 
for students.
Social media simply became the best place to communicate to people 
digitally. Other studies showed that people spend most of their digital time in social 
media platforms. Social media like Facebook and Google+ though useful can be 
lacking in certain features. These social media are built for the masses, it simply 
doesn’t have all the necessary specific features that people needs when gathering 
information with other people. Discussing any topic can be difficult since these 
websites weren’t made to forum-like, nor are the comment section made for people 
to have a thorough discussion of any interests. One of the identified problems in 
using these types of social media is the lack of privacy. Since Social media tend 
to be more open, this can be a problem for any group of people who are looking 
for privacy and exclusivity. People, like college students cannot rely on such 
websites when asking other people for help when having a problem with their 
subjects. Thus, students depend on teachers and to other fellow students as a 
guide or help when discussing or doing their current study or research. The 
information that can be found in social media platforms isn’t reliable. Social media 
is simply not the place for student researchers to gather information regarding their 
respective studies because there is also the fact that anyone can answer the 
questions, problems that student researchers post insocial groups, making students researchers unsure which of people to trust and 
refer to. The student researchers cannot determine if the people who are helping 
him have expertise in the field of study they want help in. ",Introduction
"Online databases, online journals, researcher forums and university 
websites that posts student research are available 24/7. In addition to this, 
Facebook (FB) groups where forums and an information sharing environment. 
However, FB users are diverse it is difficult for the student researchers to 
differentiate the right information from wrong information which leads the student 
researchers helpless.
In the development of the system, different data are gathered such as the 
appropriate software methodology, database and its structure, cost, target 
population, basic layout design of the website, etc. Programming languages to be 
used and the applications alongside it are part of the requirements that the 
researchers gather for the development of the system. The researchers have 
finished gathering the data needed for the development of the system, with the 
data gathered, the researchers would then proceed to execute phase one. Phase 
one involves the development of the social media and thesis archive for the 
students to use regarding their respective problems, or gathering files for them to 
read later on. Specifically, it aims to (1) develop a system that would let students 
communicate with other students to help each other in their researches by letting 
them communicate, discuss and ask each other regarding their researches; (2) to 
develop an online thesis archive for the students to access for themselves; (3) to 
develop a social media system that is user-friendly.
After this, the study would then head to the second phase, the researchers 
developed LSPU-ARCSS with the requirements from the first phase developed. 
The researchers will then need to know the answer on the usefulness and impact 
of the developed LSPU-ARCSS, specifically sought to answer the following 
research questions: (1) how to test the developed system (2) How to assess the 
effectiveness of the system to the users (3) how to develop a implementation plan.",Method
"Data Collection Methods
All research studies needs reliable information and data to ensure that all 
the facts and knowledge to keep the legitimacy of information here intact. The 
researchers have used the following methods to collect data.
Internet Research
The Internet is a vast and limitless collection of knowledge from various people 
who have expertise in specific fields. Millions of studies, thesis, researches and 
articles are always available on the Internet. Though the Internet cannot always be 
counted on the consistency of data and it can be wrong at times, the researchers
deemed that the Internet is one of the best place to collect data needed for the 
study.
Library
The library is another place where heaps of previous studies from former 
researchers are stacked. The library makes such information available and ready. 
The studies stored in the library can provide all the necessary 
guides that the researchers needed throughout the development of the system and 
the study. The library also has countless books that the researchers will have 
accessed to unlike the Internet where such books are hard to find.
Expert Consultant
The knowledge of the people who have expertise in fields that the 
researchers tackled greatly helped in gathering raw data. The opinions and 
constructive criticism of people will undoubtedly assist the researchers. One of the 
best way to further improve anything is to make sure that they have consulted 
experts in that particular field.
Observation
Observation is a useful fact finding technique that the researchers can 
employ in undertaking the research. Observation requires the researchers to see 
the different problem of the current method and provide a solution to fix or improve 
the current method for the benefit of those people.The respondents of the study were taken from the students of the LSPU CCS Sta. Cruz. All of these participants were selected through Cluster Sampling. 
This sampling method was accomplished by dividing the population into groups --
usually geographically. These groups are called clusters or blocks. The clusters 
are randomly selected, and each element in the selected clusters is used. 
The respondents of the study were taken from the students of LSPU-CCS 
from the campus of Sta. Cruz. All these participants were selected through Cluster 
Sampling Method. This sampling method was conducted where there was a 
population.",Result
"The researchers aimed to develop an online social media with a thesis archive 
to be used by the students of LSPU to help them create questions, discussions 
and ask problems for their researchers. It will also be monitored by admin of the 
website.",Discussion
