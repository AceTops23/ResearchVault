"In today’s generation technology has the biggest impact in our 
environment. People use it to minimize their efforts and maximizing their profits. 
Technology is significant to everybody’s life because of everyday use of it. From 
means of transportation, machines, and making innovations such as mobiles, 
tablets, computers that are useful to everyone in means of communications, 
learning, teaching etc. 
One of these innovations in the new way of teaching students. Teachers 
nowadays use projectors, computers and other technology to make their 
teaching techniques easier and better. But partly, other teachers are still using a 
traditional way of teaching, they still uses visual aids and other physical materials 
that the old tradition uses, because not all schools are capable enough to afford 
such technology.
Information technology provides powerful strategic and tactical tools for 
organizations which, when properly applied can provide great advantage in the 
productivity and strengthening competitiveness in the world of business. It 
contributes towards efficiency, productivity and improvement of an organization.
In schools, systems help in documenting information of students in fast 
and easy way. It is important to make lessons available and accessible to 
students for them to gain confidence in raising questions and sharing knowledge 
to teachers and their co-students. Almost everything is run by means of 
technology. No wonder that we depend on technology and almost everything we 
do. Through technology, lives become easier, faster and convenient at home and 
in school. Almost everybody is attached to it some cannot live without it. Their 
works became easier and faster.
The students and anyone who are in need of it want to use it in mobile 
phones because it is handy and easy to use. It is one of the most applicable and 
efficient way of self-studying by the use of it, students even at home can easily 
cope up with their students. Some features of the e-books are mini games that 
are interactive for the users. This is also helping tool that can test the users 
learning capacity by answering the question with the right answer.
With the idea of creating an online courseware students even at home can 
easily cope up with their teachers. Some features of the system are quizzes, this 
is also helping tool that can test the users learning capacity by answering the 
question with the right answer",Introduction
"The school where the researcher conducted the study is Don Manuel 
Rivera Memorial National High School (DMRMNHS) located at Bulilian Sur. Pila, 
Laguna headed by the principal Mrs. Emily C. Visey. The DMRMNHS has total 
population of One thousand five hundred thirteen (1,513) from grade 7 to grade 
10, with only four (4) teachers for grade seven (7) to grade ten (10). The teachers 
used books and modules as their teaching materials.
 The main problem of Don Manuel Rivera Memorial National High School is 
insufficient number of books in Filipino subject for the students. In the last two 
years the school had books and they gave it to their students but upon returning, 
it’s almost eccentric and other were lost. As mentioned by the grade 9 teacher, 
they had to buy their own books for teaching. It was also used by their students. 
There were 25 units of computer in a computer laboratory before with an internet 
access.
The researchers gain an idea of creating an online courseware that can 
generate the teacher’s lessons anytime. Through the proposed system, the 
students can easily interact during the discussion with the teachers. This online 
courseware can help them even they are at home or wherever they are, at any 
moment. The lessons and assignments can be downloaded any time they 
wanted to, in that way the students can learn even if they do not have books. 
This system also helps the teachers because the grades of the students in their 
quizzes are automatically computed. Also the system will lessen the amount of 
paper works. ",Method
"Data Collection Method
This was the instrument used by the researcher to obtain needed 
information in the process of developing the software and provide easy and 
effective way in data gathering.
This was done in order to confirm the information gathered in the questionnaire. 
A set of questions was formulated base on the result of the interview.
Observation
Upon observation, the researcher recorded and saw the present situation 
that occur. And from these instruments, the researcher was able to know the 
necessary requirements in the development of the software.
Software Methodology
The researchers used Rapid Application Development (RAD) 
methodology. It was a type of incremental model. In RAD model the components 
or functions are developed in parallel in as if they were mini projects.
It also includes the formulation of problem and planning for the solutions 
to meet the research objectives. RAD was usually used for the fast phase 
development of the system. It was a good methodology since the researchers 
develop the system rapidly to be able to implement the system on their client on 
time.",Result
"The proponents computed all the information based on the evaluation by 
the grade (7) to grade (10) students together with the teachers of Filipino subject. 
Illustrated below, the tables of total rating by the respondents.
The researchers used the Likert Scalar Method in their survey 
questionnaire. It is an ordered, one-dimensional scale from which respondents
choose one option that best aligns with their view.
Weighted Mean was used in the study to determine the factors affecting 
the relations and the overall performance of the proposed system. The weighted 
mean is similar to an arithmetic mean, where instead of each of the data points 
contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than 
others.",Discussion
