"Technology has growth over a year toward modernization and the world has 
been continuously gearing up on becoming a technology driven planet because of 
what Computer Science and Information Technology offers. Modernization have 
already invaded various facets of people lives. They have become the vital 
instruments in are daily activities. More and more establishments, institutions, 
organization even schools and universities both public and private are instituting 
technology advancement to achieve better speed, accuracy, high performance in 
the quality of their work. 
As people go through everyday living, they are not bound on things that are 
permanent. Everything changes and so the way people live. With the rapid 
development of society and the economy, an increasing number of human activity 
like creating a schedule for a school department. Technologies are now an integral 
aspects of the university student’s experience. These changes makes people live
and more convenient; it is a big advantage in almost everything to complete the 
tasks effortlessly in a lesser time. The capability of technology on helping people 
to ease task is a big necessity. It improves the way of living and it can helps the 
people in a different institution like in schools, business, organizations and many 
more. As a result, different emerging technology are being developed to ease the 
task and lessen the time of how people and do they everyday task In schools and universities the most common problem is creating a class 
schedule where it requires a lot patience considering the conflicts due to availability 
of classrooms, time, day, offered course/subject in every semester, and especially 
the availability of each teachers. Scheduling is a vital task for any system 
containing utilization of resources to fulfil some certain criteria, like curriculum
organization, academic departments. A school timetable with mandated period 
lengths and specific subjects for each period helps administrators allocate 
sufficient resources to the most important curriculum areas. Schedule should be 
organized so that the most important subjects are at optimal times of the day. The 
conflicts represent as there’s no same instructor teaching in the same room at the 
same time. Avoiding the large gaps between conflicting making schedule and 
having the same room on the same day.
Scheduling is a vital task like in academic departments they faced a periodic 
task to schedule faculty resources to teach courses to be offered over a limited 
time period. This is a time consuming exercise, quite often the manual methods 
employed will result in schedules which do not serve the best interest of either 
students of faculty. In small departments, faculty scheduling can be solved 
manually by a scheduler. In large departments developing a faculty schedule is a 
difficult task and it may take a several attempts to prepare an acceptable schedule. 
Moreover, in manual system once the schedule is prepared revision may be 
difficult, and creation of an alternate schedule. ",Introduction
"Initial Population
The process begins with a set of individuals which is called a population. 
Each individual is a solution to the problem you want to solve. An individual is 
characterized by a set of parameters (variables) known as genes. Genes are joined 
into a string to form a chromosome (solution).",Method
"The researcher obtained a deeper analysis on what are the problems that 
she can encounter during the research, designing and data gathering process. The 
researcher conduct a data gathering methods such as collecting the schedule of 
previous semester both in manual and automatically created schedule of every 
faculty members from Mrs. Mia Villarica to be able to check and apply the gather 
information needed in the study.
Library Research
The researcher visited different libraries like Colegio de San Juan De 
Letran, Laguna University, ACTS Computer College and De La Salle University 
Cavite Campus to gather information needed for the development of the proposed 
system. The researcher reviewed different thesis and Journals for the better 
improvement of the study. 
Internet Research
The researcher conducted research with the use of the internet to gain 
some additional information and to boost the knowledge and ideas about the 
developed study. The researcher browsed the internet thoroughly and found some 
several sites which helped the further understanding of the study. Some relevant 
sites that researchers found from the Google Scholar and ejournal.ph. With this, 
they found ideas and design that were implemented in the study.

Consultation
The researcher consulted with her adviser and specialize expert for other 
issues or suggestions for the better improvement of the developed system.
