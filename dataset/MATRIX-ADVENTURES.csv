"Education is the most important thing in person’s life. Education is the wealth of knowledge acquired by an individual after studying a particular subject or after experiencing life lessons that provide understanding. Education requires instruction from an individual or composed literature. The educations are results of schooling that incorporates studies of different subject. As the worlds go forward, education also evolve. Using of mobile technology as devices become more ubiquitous. Mobile learning for students and adults can be supported anywhere and anytime. The access to learning opportunities can open multiple pathways to learning. 
Walking into a classroom today is very different from walking into a classroom ten years ago. Though it may seem like a short period of time, the advances in educational technology have created a drastic change in teaching and learning. Educational technology can be defined as any digital device that aids or enhances a student’s learning. In order to incorporate technology effectively into the classroom, it is important to understand the current trends in this area. As more people gain access to technology tools and to the Internet, flipped classrooms are becoming more prevalent. 
A flipped classroom is one in which students learn important information at home on the computer through videos and recorded lectures and explore the concepts and complete activities in the classroom. In this format, the teacher is responsible for creating videos and lectures and sharing them with students online. Then, when students come into the classroom and teachers act as a guide on the side as students explore the concepts in a more in-depth manner. In actual practice, teaching and learning in a flipped classroom is more complicated. As a teacher in a flipped classroom, you must set clear expectations and be ready to act if students are not completing the required work at home. Learning in a flipped classroom requires the students to take the initiative to work at home, meaning that parents, teachers, and students must be a team in education. 
The increasing use of technology came as a boom in different forms of social media. Social media is a digital tool you use to connect with other people around the world. More and more students are becoming active and familiar with social media, and teachers are beginning to use this tool in their classroom. Students and teachers also use social media to connect with others somewhere else in the country or the world. As a teacher, he needs to work to make these connections. Students would then communicate with each other via social media to learn more about different cultures. This can culminate with a presentation or essay about what the students learned. When using social media in a classroom, whether to interact with students, connect them to someone around the world, or one of the many other possibilities, it's important to remember to teach students how to be safe online. Social media can be a great tool to teach many different subjects, but students must know how to use the tool and stay safe when doing so. Since students will most likely be using tools that are available to everyone, there is always a chance that someone will try to prey on young people's naturally trusting nature. Students should be taught how to handle these situations and 

what information is not okay to share online. 
Similar to a flipped classroom, educational technology is also making it easier for students to engage in. mobile learning. Portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets, allow student’s access to the Internet from wherever they are. This has opened up possibilities for students to learn while they are out in the world. For example, when on a class trip to the zoo, students can use an Internet-connected tablet to further research about different animals. Some may argue that if they are using the devices at the zoo, they are missing out on crucial experiences; however, if these devices are allowing them to explore information further, they are only enhancing their experiences. Mobile learning is growing faster than ever globally. The instructional design of mobile learning requires that learning become more modular, contextual, and “bite-sized” to provide flexibility and clear outcomes before moving to the next level of learning. Powerful tools are needed to ensure learners can connect, collaborate and communicate effectively in an academic setting on the go.
",Introduction
"An initial interview to the one of the teachers in Longos Elementary School was done in the beginning of the study. According to the result of the interview, Mathematics is one of the most important subjects that their students need to learn because mathematics is very useful to our daily life 


and mathematics is not a difficult subject, a student just need to analyze it and understand it well. 
Overall, the study is made because the researchers believed that kids nowadays especially those who are in the middle age are not paying attention when it comes to mathematics, because in their minds, mathematics is so difficult which made them feel bored in dealing with it. So as the contrast to that statement, the researchers made a possible idea when it comes to dealing Mathematics with a twist and it turned out to be the “Mathrix Adventure: A Mathematical Adventure Game Using Virtual Reality Application” The game targets to answer the following questions; (1) how to design and develop a mobile game that focuses on the Mathematics subject? (2) how to design and develop a virtual reality mobile game in learning and gaining knowledge with basic arithmetic operations? (3) what tools should be used in the development of the 3D and virtual reality mobile game?
The researchers sought the problems identified through the development of the application which is (1) to design and develop a mobile game that focused on mathematics subject, (2) to design and develop a virtual reality mobile game in learning and gaining knowledge in basic arithmetic operations,(3) to identify the tools that should be used in the development of 3D and virtual reality mobile game. The problems that identified in this phase have been solved by the researchers and the “Mathrix Adventure: A Mathematical Adventure Game using Virtual Reality Application” is developed.
The second phase of this study aimed to test the usefulness of the mobile game entitled “Mathrix Adventure: A mathematical adventure game using virtual reality application”. The researchers sought the problems which is (1) how to perceive the acceptability of the target audience? (2) how to identify if there’s a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test? (3) how to identify if there’s a significant difference of pretest and posttest in terms of time?
",Method
"Data Collection Methods
The Data collection method is the part of the study where the researchers collected important data about the progress of the study.

The Internet Research -The internet is the major source of journal, current news, and books. Information on the internet can be brought up to date data immediately. 
Interview -The researchers ask pre planned questions to the clients about what area did the children thinks that hardest subject. The researchers also asked question that are needed to fulfill the stated problems. 
The information that was gathered were then analyzed and processed to identify the main problem and find the solution to it. The researchers would simply able to make a solution that would fulfill the needs of the client.
Library Research – The researchers visited the library to have a detailed information and research to find materials that is relevant to the study being developed. The developers used this kind of method of gathering information in the improvement of the developed application. 
The Researchers search for a possible related literature and studies and gather information like codes to improve the game.
",Result
This Chapter presents the result of the hypothesis of the study and discussion of procedure that the researchers did.,Discussion
