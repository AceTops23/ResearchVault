"Social and organizational changes in the economic environment are numerous and extensive. Hence, it is important for Human Resource Management (HRM) to be comprehensive, high in quality, fast, flexible, and in line with current trends, because it is few of the parameters of a successful business entity. The use of information and communication technology becomes an imperative for HRM, as well as the other activities in the organization. However, modern knowledge economy and labor statistics impose the need for consistent initiatives in real time, so the HRM department must implement these initiatives before the actual employment of workers. 
Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS) is a computer software intended for the simplification and acceleration of HR management processes, and improvement of its quality via automation of the basic (routine) objectives and activities. Due to this advantage, more and more organizations applied HRMIS to their work process. Development of the HRMIS unified standards is of key significance for improvement of an HR management’s effectiveness and transparency in certain departments, as well as in public sector in general. In addition, it will be a significant step in the introduction of the unified e-governance system in the country.
The move to a web-based system or a corporate intranet is currently the top cost-cutting strategy at use within organizations that utilize HRMIS nowadays. The use of these systems improves efficiency within the organization. For employees that are familiar with the Internet, using a web-based system is convenient. Hence placing benefits, HR Online delivers a complete, flexible, and fully hosted HR administration system that enables any organization to perform all HR operations with ease.
Since LSPU Main Campus is now undergoing massive changes because of the initiative to be accredited under ISO 9001: 2008, there are problems and dilemma that unexpectedly occurred like the urgency, the availability of information, the safekeeping of credential information and its credibility, and the alike.
Thus, this serves as impetus for the establishment of the HR Online to unravel the issues concerning management of information of LSPU Santa Cruz Campus. The study aimed to evaluate the developed system and use different methods such as black box testing. This research also designed a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of the study to show the specific cost if it is confirm for the benefits of the study. 
Furthermore, the research regarding the Human Resource Management Information System of the said locale of the study will be a great tool in response to the needs and problems that arose as per the ISO certification requires to such institutions like the LSPU.
",Introduction
"In any organization, it is crucial to have a definite and effective way of ensuring quality services to its clientele. As it is manifested, most organizations are engaging and adapting the latest technologies, as much as possible, to cater proactively the needs of their clients. Hence it is made to efficiently utilize the time of the people on the frontline service on any organization. The first phase of the study aimed to design and develop a Human Resource Management Information System for LSPU-SCC using web based system that can handle the employees’ information, manage request and some HR functions. Specifically, it sought to (1) identify the functional requirements of the human resource management information system; (2) recognize the requirements, if authorizes for the development of the human resource management information system; and (3) determine the appropriate development tool for the study. 
After the researchers formulated and accomplished the objectives. It identified that the functional requirements needed the following; (a) an online web based software for the study; (b) the online web based software is perfect for the requirements of the human resource management information system; (c) the Rapid Application Development is the perfect research methodology for development of the online web based system.
The second phase of the study entitled “HR Online” focused to evaluate effectiveness and accuracy of the developed system. It specifically sought to answer the following questions: (a) How to test the system’s functionality by the intended users? (b) How to consider the acceptability and performance of the user in emerging the developed system?  (c) How to develop an implementation plan for the proposal and approval from the Office of the President for the full deployment of the online human resource management information system in LSPU-Santa Cruz Campus?
",Method
"The researchers explored a deeper analysis about the problems that they have encountered during the research. In order to gather information needed for the study, the following methods were applied: 
Library Research is used by the researchers to make the study feasible. The researchers visited libraries within the university and also other universities. They gathered information used to anchor to support for the conduct of this study. 
Internet Research is used by the researchers to make the study feasible. The researchers used the computer to browse the internet. They gathered information to be used in the proposed system. Some items needed for the system has also been found in the internet. The internet has been a great help for searching the process for the building of hardware and the creating of codes
Interview is used by the researchers to make the study feasible. The admin office supported the project by accommodating the interviewer to conduct an interview about their entire process and some possible user of the system. 
Consultation helped the researchers for the development of the system. The consultant gave generous amount of their time and knowledge in guidance to the student researchers. The consultant gave ideas to the researchers in developing the system. The design of the system was suggested by the consultant. More so, the consultant helped the researchers in the coding of the system. With the help of the consultant, the researchers were able to build and analyze the system very smoothly.
",Result
"The Results and Discussion presented the analysis and interpretation of the tests results acquired from the conducted techniques by the researchers. It also discussed if the study entitled “HR Online: An Online Human Resource Management Information System of LSPU-SCC” has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its user.
The researchers formulated the survey questionnaires along with its utilizing adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) which has the quality products to take advantage for the system testing and evaluation. . The researchers used a five-point Likert scale that show on table below.
