"In todays modern age where people craved for an answer to their 
never ending needs, technology filled the gap that people seek. Technology is 
rapidly evolving leveling the needs of the people minimizing the efforts 
needed in their daily routine and in the workplace. Technological innovation 
causes a huge impact in our environment and people nowadays are living in 
an easier way that minimizes their efforts. Technology is a systematic study of 
the methods and techniques that is being used in the industry, research, 
agriculture, and commerce. Technology is significant because it is constantly 
changing the demandsof every individual. It is widely used to ascent the 
quality of one’s work. Computer and smartphone are the best technological 
innovations that are commonly used in todays generation and being relied on 
by users in their everyday routine. Having a website and mobile management 
system is a multi-purpose system that helps the user lessen the manualwork 
and avoiding the hassleness of so many paperworks and also the time spent 
in record tracking. Having a cellphone or smartphone is very handy because 
you can easily access anything, anywhere, anyplace, and anytime because 
you can bring it anywhere without any hassle.
Having a management system also means an ease in data storage 
and data organizing, with this the hassleness of collecting every paper would 
be much easier and faster while also tracking the recorded data with accuracy. Like most document submission everything has a deadline to be 
reached, if the document is sebt late or after the given deadline the document 
will be considered as null or not accepted at all, if this is also applied in a 
management system the hassleness of submitting late reports or decuments 
will also be lessen or avoided because of the given time for the submission.
The researchers sought to create an automated management system 
entitiled “Cross-platform Unified Presidents Report” for the Laguna State 
Polytechnic University. It is an automated report management system that 
accepts any given documents that will be sent to the president. The user can 
send the document 2 times to finalize the their report if there is any revisions 
needed. Also before before the submitted documents the admin will check or 
review that submitted document. If the submitted document or report is 
approved it will be compiled with the rest of the approved documents that will 
be sent to the president and of the document is flagged as disapproved it will 
notify the one who sent the report or document to revise the document with 
comments of corrections. Since the system can be viewed in a website and 
smartphone the user can check for any updates anytime because it is 
uploaded on the internet and can be checked while there is Internet in the 
area. The user can only view the system online because the users has 
different accounts the system can only be viewed online to also access their 
own accounts. The mobile application cannot also be viewed offline because 
the users need to access their account before using the mobile application. 
The purpose of the mobile application is for viewing of the submitted and 
requested reports.",Introduction
"Laguna State Polytechnic University, the associate deans, deans, and 
unit heads submit their report quarterly to update their status for the past 
three (3) months. The researchers conducted an interview with Miss Ma. 
Erlyn Eroles unit head of the LSPU Main Campus Planning Office and found 
out that even if the reports are only once every three(3) months, the different 
types of documents that are being sent to the secretary are far too many 
because there many deans and other unit heads who pass their documents at 
the same day of the given schedule of submission, also the secretary has to 
check all of the documents that were sent, some would be sent back for 
revision byr others tend to be left out because of the paperwork, some send 
their document late the the given deadline and their manual process. Miss 
Ma. Erlyn Eroles compiles all of the finalized doucment and then creates a 
powerpoint that shows the summary of the per quarter and annual report. 
There are four (4) campuses that are also fowarding their quarterly reports to 
the campus director. Thus the other campuses have the same process with 
the Sta. Cruz Campus.
Based on the preliminary investigation conducted by the researchers
problems has been identified in the current process, this has been backed up 
with the interview that the researchers conducted with Miss Ma. Erlyn Eroles 
Planning Officer of Laguna State Polytechnic University SantaCruz Campus 
and she is willing to for a systematic system in handling presidents reports 
management system. In overall of the conducted research the following 
problems has been recognized (a) late document submission; (b) tedious 
process in monitoring the reports; (c) manual checking of the submitted report 
documents for revisions; (d) tendency to misplace documents; (e) difficulty in 
reports and documant retrieval (f) consolidation of reports.
Specifically the proposed study sought to address the following questions: 
(1) to analyze the current process of handling president report management 
system; (2) to design a web and mobile applicatio that will help the users 
manage reports; (3) to evaluate the “Cross-platform Unified Presidents 
Report” with regards to the user acceptance and behavioral intention of the 
intended users",Method
"The researchers used several methods for them to conduct some problems 
and challenges for them to know what is part that needed to improve and 
researchers start to collect data such as researching in library reading previous 
thesis, reading magazines, reading methodology books that related on the study
and surfing through the use of internet (World Wide Web), collecting and 
comparing related studies and literature that somehow similar to study that 
researchers is developing. The researchers conducted an interview to the one of 
the admin of the Laguna State Polytechnic University to be able to gather or get 
accurate information about the problems that they were encounter during report
period. The following instruments were used in order to make the study feasible. 
Interview 
Interview is a verbal conversation between two people with the object of 
collecting relevant information for the purpose of the research. Interviews are 
particularly useful getting the story behind a participants experience and it also 
helps the researcher to conduct intensive individual interviews with a small 
number of respondents to explore their perspectives on a particular idea, program 
or situations. Research interview involves the researcher to reproduce some 
information who coordinates the process of the conversation and asks questions 
and interviewee, who responds to those questions. Interview help or make things 
easier to the researchers to have qualitative research to have conversation where 
questions are asked and following up or probing there answer to elicit information 
or data. 
The researchers interviewed the admin for getting or gathering information 
about the procedure of the manual process and also the problem and challenges
that being catch or encountered using the manual process so the researcher will 
be able to have a guide for them to make their study develop. Interviews are the 
excellent way to gather or to get detailed information.Library Research
The Library Research involves the step by step process used to gather 
information in order to write paper or to complete the study successfully. The library 
serve as the sources of information for the researchers. 
Library is truly multidisciplinary resource featuring a diversified mx of 
scholarly journals, trade publications, magazines and other timely sources that 
help the researchers to describe, analyze and/or evaluate information found in 
primary sources and by repackaging information, secondary sources make 
information more accessible. A few examples of secondary sources of books, 
journal and magazines article, encyclopedia, dictionaries, and hand book and 
those way will help the researcher to have a guidelines in making their study useful 
and functional.
Successful library research help the researchers to define the systematic 
study and investigation of some aspect of library and information science where 
conclusion are based on the analysis of data or information collected in 
accordance with pre-established research design and methodologies that will help 
the researchers to have an idea on how they make their study easier. 
During library session, researches are the basics on how to conduct the 
data or information that is fit to their study or data that can be used to their study 
or the information that related on the study.
Researcher use the library research process first the researcher define their 
topic, develop a search strategies, evaluate their sources, take careful of their 
notes, revising those information was gathered and document their sources. Those 
step helps the researches to conduct or to get important information that is relevant 
on their study. 
Internet Research 
In gathering information, the internet serves as the most usable sources. 
Browsing the internet gives the researchers more explanation about the study and 
helps in understanding some information related to the study. It helps the 
researchers about creating some codes and collecting some related literature and 
studies.
Internet research is the way that researcher practices in getting internet 
information. Through searches on the internet hundreds or thousands of pages 
can often be quickly found with some relation to given topic. Internet Research is 
skills and understanding how to use this guide. Researchers choose a topic that 
relates to the current curriculum. Using these skills in a real context creates a much 
more interest on their study.",Result
