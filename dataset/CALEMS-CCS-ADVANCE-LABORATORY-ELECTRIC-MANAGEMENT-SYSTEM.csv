"Technology is the basic need for every country to stand and compete with 
other nations. After books, the wheel of technology comes next as an important 
technology as part of our lives. Most advanced countries have the high competition 
level in the world in any field. The countries which do not develop ideas as the age 
passes remained far behind the success and innovation. The technological stand 
of the country shows the country’s power and status at the global level. 
Computerization is a conclusive evidence of the advancement in science and 
technology, which task is to maximize its purpose, primarily in education. Electricity 
is the greatest technology, as it made possible many advanced technologies 
depend on it, such as the computer and modern appliances. Electricity is critical 
for the growth of industry, modern communication and advanced forms of travel, 
such as the airplane and today's automobiles.
Technology nowadays is very important especially in terms of preventing 
fire, security and safeties. The most important part of technology is safety to avoid 
fire and save life. There’s a government group who help to prevent fire the BFP 
(Bureau of Fire Protection) this group of people helps the government to avoid fire 
accident and to prevent property damage. Philippines is now influenced by 
technology, many kinds of gadgets and devices appeared in the market. There’s 
an automation system used by the establishment and other company by 
preventing fires and limiting damages, it can assure that work operations will 
continue without interruption. 
Home automation makes life simpler for human beings. Various efforts are 
made in this arena. Our effort is to transform life into a simple way using modern 
technology. For fulfilling that desire wireless LAN-based home automation is 
selected. Nowadays people grab their various smart devices to access to different 
type of connection because of the continuously upgrading each different day and 
the people has grown the knowledge about the use of technology and still creating 
new ideas to improve more and make easier for individuals.
",Introduction
"College of Computer Studies is one the college in LSPU Sta. Cruz, Laguna 
that uses a computer laboratory. There are four (4) computer laboratory rooms in 
the college. Inside the laboratory room are computers, ceiling fans, lights, aircon. 
There are several teachers who use the laboratory rooms every day. Sometimes 
1-3 hours and 1-5 hours is the duration time of every class inside the laboratory. 
The researchers conducted an interview regarding the current process 
inside the computer laboratory rooms of the college. Every time they come in the 
laboratory they use to open the breakers for them to access the electrical 
appliances that manually operated by the faculty. 
The Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Main Campus is 
focusing on the security and calamity prevention of the campus. Especially to those 
place that has a higher vulnerability to create fire when there’s a short circuit. Some 
of the reasons why it happens is because of the manual process they use, they 
manually operate to turn on /off the electrical appliances. On that manual process 
some incident happens and still going until now. The staff of the college forgot and 
leave the laboratory room without turning off the breakers, the lights and other 
appliances are turned on overnight. That’s why the researchers aim to develop a 
system that can help the college to provide the safety and to avoid fire in the 
college. The system entitled “CALEMS: CCS Advance Laboratory Electric 
Management System” is an automation system that can help the college from fire 
incident and to avoid risk of damaging electrical appliances. With the use of this 
system the user can control the electrical appliances through web browser and 
system.",Method
"The researchers used several methods in collecting data such as 
researching in library reading previous thesis and surfing through the use of 
internet, collecting and comparing related studies and literature that somehow similar to study. The researchers conducted an interview with the Secretary and 
Professor/Instructor of the College of Computer Studies at Laguna State 
Polytechnic University to be able to gather information about the problems that 
they encountered during the daily use of Laboratory room.
Observation
The researchers used this method in additional statement on what had been 
noticed inside the Computer Laboratory rooms.
Interview 
To further understands the problem that the researchers collected, the 
researchers conducted an interview regarding the problem that they encountered 
to the current process of laboratory rooms. This requirements is needed to more 
understand what would be the possible solution for the problem. Conducting an 
interview will help the researchers to create a system that would not affect to 
environment of the CCS Computer Laboratory. The researchers conducted an 
interview to know the whole condition of safeness of the college by asking an 
information to the Electrical expert and interview to Mr. Dick an Electrical 
Engineering who manages the electrical issues in LSPU Sta. Cruz Main Campus.
Library Research
For additional information about handling an electrical connected to system, 
the researchers went to library to get an information on how to make the study 
feasible. The researchers also got a tech gap analysis to see the differences and 
recommendation of each thesis related to the study that can help and use to the 
proposed system. In this library the researchers also got some foreign and local 
related studies that can serve as guide on the study. 
Internet Research
Another technique for gathering information is the internet. It is a form of 
research method that can help the researchers to gain knowledge and improve the 
study in terms of development. It also served as guide to know the exact 
information on what hardware specification to be use. Using internet the 
researchers can get additional codes, ideas on designing and tutorials on 
YouTube, w3school, open source code etc. that can enhance and build our 
knowledge in the world of programming.
",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if the 
study entitled ”CALEMS: CCS Advance Laboratory Electric Management System” 
has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its clients.",Discussion
