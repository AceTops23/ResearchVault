"The office of the Liliw MDRRMO is currently using only a paper in recording 
and managing their incident report. After its recorded, the incident report form will be 
placed in the folder as form of storage. In this status, the possibility of the destruction 
and misplacement of the report form is in the high risk because of this kind of storage. 
In that reason the researcher developed a system that improve the efficiency in terms 
of recording and storing of the report in the office.
Disasters and accidents are rampant all throughout the world. Due to the effects 
of climate change, the earth suffers from strong and destructive typhoons, flooding, 
landslides, droughts, and other disasters like earthquakes. Natural disasters contribute 
to 60,000 annual death globally. On the other hand, man-made disasters like accidents, 
especially road accidents are also abundant in every country around the globe. In Asia, 
according to the WHO (World Health Organization), there are 316,000 people dead 
each year due to road accidents in South East Asia alone, contributing to 25% of the 
total of road accidents death around the globe.
Philippines, a small archipelagic country in Southeast Asia, suffers from both 
of these disasters. As a tropical country and given its location and nature, the country 
is one of the most disaster-prone country in the world. The country is also one of the 
countries in the region with the highest number of road accidents per year. In an article 
posted in the website manilastandard.net, CALABARZON has recorded 2,386 road 
crash incidents, or 16.5% of the total incident in the country.
To prepare for these disasters, the country formed an agency under the effect of 
R.A 10121 or the “Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act” which is known today as the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council 
or NDRRMC, which is under the Office of Civil Defense. The main purpose of the 
agency is to provide assistance and rescue response when a disaster hit. Among the 
agency’s main function is to provide and give knowledge regarding disasters through 
information dissemination and reports.",Introduction
"The town of Liliw is a 4th class municipality located at the foot of Mount 
Banahaw. The town is composed of 33 barangays divided into upland and lowland 
areas. According to the 2015 town census, the town currently has a population of 36, 
582 people. The municipality is regarded as one of the tourist attractions of the province 
of Laguna due to its weather and cold-water springs. Several offices run the 
municipality of Liliw like the tourism, health, public order and safety, and the disaster 
and rescue, to name a few. 
Due to the town’s mountainous topography and high elevation, the town is 
surrounded by series of high sloping roads and hairpin curves. Also, the town has lots 
of waterfalls and fast flowing streams and rivers especially in the upland and high 
elevated areas which is popular among local residents and tourists. The town’s 
mountainous profile is also one of the reasons why Liliw is one of the most disaster and 
accident-prone areas with a recorded average of 2-3 accidents per day. The town also 
suffers from natural disasters like floods and landslides. 
The office of MDRRMO, or the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction 
Management Office is one of the offices that serves as responders for emergency 
situations like accidents, disasters, and many others along with the fire department and 
the police. In connection to the law that mandated the formation of the NDRRMC, or the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council, which is the R.A 10121, 
otherwise known as the “Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act”, 
gives authority to the agency as the main organization responsible for risk management. 
In correlation to the section 12, paragraph A of the law stated above, it is mandated to 
have a Local Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office, or LDRRMO in every 
province, city and municipality. Also written in section 12 of the law are the services 
offered by the agency which includes risk assessment and contingency planning, 
information dissemination, emergency response and rescue operations are among the 
many services offered by the agency. 
The Liliw MDRRMO, which serves as the main authority and emergency 
response team during disasters and accidents, has to create report whenever they 
respond to a case as one of their many services and sends it to the Provincial Office, or 
the PDRRMO (Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office). According to 
the transcribed interview, included in the report that the office creates are name and 
address of the victim, nature of the accident, or if a natural disaster, the type is indicated. 
These reports are written in an incident report form and compiled in folders. The cases 
are also written in a log book which serves as their database. The reports are then 
consolidated and then sent to the PDRRMO Office.",Method
"Population of the Study
Population, by definition, is the group to which the researcher would like the 
results to be generalizable. Also, population could be the set of all cases of interest and 
might be any size, or cover any geographical area. The researchers could specify an 
even smaller and manageable distinction of population called the study population. 
The client, the office of MDRRMO has a functional body consisting of 18 
regular personnel and various volunteers from different barangays and organizations. 
In regards to this, the researchers have identified a total of four hundred and one (401) 
individuals as the total population of the study. This consist of three hundred and thirty three (333) barangay officials, fifty (50) local residents, and eighteen (18) MDRRMO 
personnel. They then narrowed it down to a total accessible population of eighty-eight
(88) individuals using stratified random sampling. The final number of respondents 
consist of twenty (20) barangay officials, fifty (50) local citizens, and eighteen (18) 
MDRRMO personnel, which constitutes 22.72%, 56.82%, and 20.49% of the total 
number of identified populations respectively.Data Collection Methods
 Described by Zindzy Garcia, data collection plays an vital role in conducting 
research study. Inaccurate data collection can result into production of false output, it 
is also important to evaluate what type of method the researcher will use in collecting 
data for research study. Data collection is process of gathering and evaluation of 
information, this process is usually executed in systematic order. First, the researcher 
will state the research problem, then it follows by testing hypothesis lastly the 
researcher conclude the results and discussion of the research study. It is especially 
important for accurate data collection in order to maintain the integrity of the research. 
Both the selection of appropriate data collection tools and well-delineated guidelines 
for their right use lessen the possibility of making mistakes.
Interview Methods
Interviews are more structured in quantitative than in qualitative research. In 
conducting structured interview, the researcher asks only to the respondent standard set 
of questions and adds nothing.
The researchers conducted various face to face interviews. These interviews are 
non-standardized. The interview questions are a mixture of W, H and open-ended 
questions. These questions help the researchers gather information regarding the 
agency and understand their process of information dissemination. Face to face 
interviews have advantage because the researcher can establish connection with 
prospective participants to gain their cooperation. This also convenient because it giveshighest response rates in survey research the researcher also clarify the uncommon 
answer from the responder and ask follow up question.
Library Research
Discussed by Elmer E. Rasmuson, library research is done by step-by-step 
process of gathering information in order to complete research material. 
Online Research
According in publication by Pete Comley and Jon Beaumont, the online 
qualitative research was rarely used especially in Europe because the qualitative 
research usually conducted offline. Online research includes Online focus group 
discussion, this is the digital version of the offline face-to-face group discussion it is 
usually compose of 6 to 8 people participating in discussion through dedicated online 
chat space moderated by researcher. One good example of this today is the group chat 
which is the major feature of Facebook messenger.
Internet search of various topics, online researches, articles, journals and other 
media are also used by the researchers for this study. As mentioned above, the 
information gathered through online research are classified as secondary. The 
researchers gathered needed information in the web that can contribute in the related 
studies in their study. Some of this are dissertations, articles and many more.
Consultation with the Experts
The researchers consulted with their adviser, statistician, technical editor and 
other specialist that can help in proper development of the system. First, the researcher 
consulted to the thesis adviser which is the person who assist and guide the researcher 
through the process of topic selection and construction. Second, the researcherconsulted to the technical editor that guide them in editing technical documents. The 
technical editor also checked the grammar, punctuation, format and content of the 
research paper. Lastly, the researcher consulted to the statistician who guided the 
researcher in using mathematical techniques to analyzed and interpreted the collected 
data and develop conclusion.",Result
"This chapter presents the results and the discussion to support the methodology 
utilized in the achievement of the objectives. The presentation usually guided by the 
specific objectives or problem of the research study.",Discussion
