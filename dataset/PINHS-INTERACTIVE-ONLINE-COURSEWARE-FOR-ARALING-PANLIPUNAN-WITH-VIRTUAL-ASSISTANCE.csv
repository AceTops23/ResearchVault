"Today, our society is more technologically advanced than it has ever been. Over the past few years, schools have become more progressive where technology have been implemented in the teaching methods. A quote by John Dewey from his book Democracy and Education stated “If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow.” Integrating technology into classrooms is not only essential in preparing the students for the future, but it is also an effective teaching method. The use of technology in the classroom provides more of a personalized learning experience and gives students a widespread availability to engage in learning.
Courseware can be defined as educational material intended as teaching aids and kits for teachers and learning process among students.  Teaching and learning materials which are currently used for schools are combination of traditional learning material such as textbook with modern materials like electronic publications such as videotape, CD-ROM and website. The availability of this technology would enable all schools to exploit various information sources besides making the school more open and easily accessible by the relevant parties whether student or teachers.
According to the study of T. S., Chong (2013), “Advancements should be reflected on the classroom and laboratory teaching. They believe that the classroom lectures should be conducted in a way that the most students be active participants in the discussions. They strongly believe that the new technologies
cannot replace lecturers, but they can enhance them. Therefore, they proposed a “courseware” approach to the way that they are conducting classroom lectures. Courseware approach means that the lectures will be produced by the help of a multimedia software. Lectures will be put together by faculty and the results will be portable in a way that they can be accessed by the students at the computer laboratories and used at the state-of-the-art classrooms. An interactive tutorial package could be of tremendous benefit to these students. The interactive software package, courseware, could also be used as an effective learning tool for independent/long distance education. The findings of this study also suggested that high academic ability students would obtain high gain scores regardless of the instructional strategies.”
Online Courseware is sure to catch up as learners’ demand alternatives to the traditional classroom, education on demand, new strategies to effectively work with students of different abilities and addressing digital student in a global world. 
",Introduction
"Population of the Study
The researchers used Stratified Random Sampling with Proportional Allocation to get the number of respondents for the study. This sampling technique is applicable because it is a procedure for dividing a sample along the strata in a stratified sample. The higher the stratum size, the higher the number of respondents you will get.
",Method
"Data Collection Methods
This section shows the methods that have been performed by the researchers to gather data needed. The researchers need to get those to add them and be the content of the online courseware for the development of the study “PINHS Interactive Online Courseware for Araling Panlipunan with Virtual Assistance”.

Interview
The researchers conducted an interview to the Principal and some teachers to gather information that was the basis of the development of the study.
Survey
The researchers performed a pre-assessment survey to the students to get the data needed in doing the study. Their answers were important for the researchers to see if their school really needed to develop and use a learning system.  
Brainstorming
The researchers performed brainstorming to bring their ideas together and critic each other’s opinion that helped them in finalizing the features and contents of the proposed study and also to know its limitations. 
Internet Research
The researchers used internet in researching in finding additional ideas and information for the courseware, also the complications and limitations that  possibly happened during the development of the study. It helped the researchers in finalizing the features for the courseware.
Observation
The researchers observed the surroundings of Plaridel Integrated National High School to gather additional information and to observed the problems being encountered using their current process.
Library Research
The researchers used the University Library and CCS Research Laboratory of Laguna State Polytechnic University to search some ideas that contribute to the proposed courseware and also to search for some related studies that add to their ideas.
",Result
"The researchers developed an interactive online courseware which is focused only to Araling Panlipunan subject curriculum of Plaridel Integrated National High School with 1707 total number of students from grade seven to grade ten. The courseware provides downloadable handouts lesson of students to have an advance study in academic subject Araling Panlipunan. Interactive lectures were discussed by the virtual teacher by using images, sounds, animation and some activities for self-assessment of the students with the use of Adobe Flash Professional CC that makes the learning of the students enthusiastic and fun. Also, this online courseware helps the teachers in spreading lessons, lectures and quizzes. Teachers as well as the students can monitor the quizzes results.",Discussion
