"Within the last decade, parallel efforts in various regions of the world called 
for a shift in paradigm from the prevailing emergency management framework to 
disaster risk management to reverse the increasing trend in disaster occurrence 
and loss, especially from small and medium scale disasters. These highlighted the 
need for proactive disaster management activities and the significant role of local 
communities. The community based approach also corrected the defects of the 
top down approach in development planning and disaster management which 
failed to address local needs, ignored the potentials of local resources and 
capabilities, and may have even increased people’s vulnerabilities (Berlin& Carl 
Strom, 2011).
The Philippine government exists to support the local government in times 
of emergencies and according to their level assignment, all national government 
offices in the field shall support the operations of the local government. Every 
incidents are a large part of the work day for ambulance, rescuers, police, firemen 
and healthcare personnel. Their mission at the incident site basically consists of 
medical treatment, crime rescue, fire rescue and transportation to the hospital 
(Berlin& Carl Strom, 2011). Another task are for the rescuers to face at the 
incidents site is to establish local healthcare management, which in the case of a 
large scale incident or several incidents at the same time communities with and
update regional healthcare management to confirm that they are in –fact dealingwith a major incidents (Ruler, Nilsson & Vikstrom,2006).
Computer and mobile phones are one of the innovations that has a very 
strong impact not just on technology but on the lives of many people. Since right 
now is an information age, almost everything they do and need, relies on the 
computer along with the internet. Both are very beneficial weather in comes to 
science, business, heath and others especially in the field record management. 
Although the existence of record management may be as old as the offices 
themselves, most offices are still not sure about the role that records management 
plays in their daily operation. This raises serious concerns as to whether the role 
of records management is reflected in the plans of any of this organization. If 
records are properly managed, it becomes very easy to locate any record, if the 
necessary information is available.
",Introduction,,,
"The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Offic7e (PDRRMO) is 
located at Santa Cruz and there has different Disaster Risk Reduction 
Management Office (DRRMO) in every municipalities of Alaminos, Bay, Binan, 
Cabuyao, Calamba, Caluan, Cavinti, Famy, Kalayaan, Liliw, Los Banos, Luisiana, 
Lumban, Mabitac, Magdalena, Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Paete, Pagsanjan, Pakil, 
Pangil, Pila, Rizal, San Pablo, San Pedro, Siniloan, Santa Maria, Santa Rosa, and 
Victoria that is responsible for their perspective area. They are built to serve people 
who needs in case of emergency. Without them there will be no longer government 
office that you can rely on when the disaster come. No one knows when, where, 
what will be the incident that can face on in everyday lives. So with the help from 
them and other government agencies the people will be lessen the struggle when 
disaster came.
The PDRRMO is still uses a manual process of recording information and 
making reports, since the PDRRMO handles all the reports of 4 district in Laguna 
many problems that may cause of delays in the process. They didn’t immediately 
rescue the victim because of the difficulty and extended received of the report. This 
will become hassle to the representative in the municipality to dispatch the report 
to the PDRRMO. It will be hard for them to generate all the report because they 
still use manual process in handling the report. These are the specific problems 
based on the observation by the researchers gathered. Sometimes the PDRRMO 
didn’t notice if it is a prank call or not. There are times that the PDRRMO don’t 
receive the report on time Also they encountered having a hard time saving and 
searching for the information of a certain file. ",Method,,,
"Data Collection Methods
The researchers used different instrument to obtain the needed information 
in the process of developing the software and provide easy and effective way in 
data gathering. In collecting more ideas the researchers used the following 
methods to gain more knowledge in their study.
Research Interview
The researcher conducted interview with the employee, representative of 
municipalities, also the head of the PDRRMO in order to gather information 
regarding how each of them process, creating of a report , and how they response 
in the certain incidents.
Library Research
Library research was used by the researchers to gather related literature 
and studies in additional information were also gathered such as the methods of a 
research which was used to improve the concept of the study. 
Internet Research
Internet research was used by the researchers to make the study capable. 
The researchers used computer to browse the internet. Gathered information to 
be used in the proposed system. The internet was a great help in the searching for 
the process of building the software and creating the codes. 
Observation
Upon observation, the researcher could record and see the present 
situation that occurs. And from these instruments, the researcher was able to know 
the necessary requirements in the development of the software.
Questionnaires
The researchers developed questionnaires for the preliminary investigation
to collect data quickly. For exploration of patterns and trend which help to describe 
what is happening. Also to allow the feedback from representative of PDRRMO.
After reviewed and passed by adviser, the questionnaire was distributed to theResearch Interview

After reviewed and passed by adviser, the questionnaire was distributed to theselected respondents of the research. At first the researchers used ISO 9126 
questioners to evaluate and present to the respondents in some cases the 
Municipality Representative asked and they answered it with confusions Therefore 
from the second time the researchers changed the questioners a combination of 
TAM and ISO to see the effectiveness of the developed system.
