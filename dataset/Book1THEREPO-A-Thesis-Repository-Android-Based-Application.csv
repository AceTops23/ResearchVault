"In today’s generation, technology is advancing in a very fast phase and 
this is the time of experimentation of innovative technology. The advancement 
of technology makes the lives of the people more comfortable and easy. The 
most trending technology in the 20th century is mobile application which is 
accessible in all smart phones that runs Android OS. Mobile application have 
many uses, it can be used for educational purposes, games, socializing, 
entertainment and etc.
Researching is the process of gathering information of different
research topics. The availability of research topics in the web is not easy to
access. While, library provides research information and research materials, 
this can cause too much time consumption for the researchers every time 
they need to gather information. Also some library has strict rules in barrowing 
research materials and also they are not allowed to take pictures inside the
thesis area.
Web application and mobile application is one of the most used
technologies by people. It can be a solution for helping the researchers to
research easily. Other studies are showing that the people are spending or 
using mobile application or their smart phones. The Mobile applications we 
have in our smart phone are very useful to us every time. There are Mobile 
applications like Webster Dictionary or Google Chrome that can be useful in 
terms of searching. This mobile application is built for the people who have 
specific needs for gathering information of the finished study.
That is what mobile application can do in our technology today. A 
mobile application that contains research information will help the researchers 
to lessen their time every time they needed to go in the library for research 
purpose. It can also minimize also the effort of the researchers to gathered 
information, as long they have the mobile application to their smartphones or 
tablets with WIFI connection or data connection.
",Introduction
"Searching is one of the things a researchers do every time they need 
to gather information. In the school university, the way of searching research 
information is a challenging process. The students of the Laguna State 
Polytechnic University (LSPU) are manually visiting the library for research 
purpose. The students are manually writing the research information that can 
help their studies and also can be used as related studies. Sometimes, the 
students became frustrated in writing information and repeatedly visit in the 
library that can cause a lot of efforts and time consumption. Also, the library 
staff is storing the old thesis in the stock room because of a lack of space 
inside the thesis area. Thus, there is need to develop a system which can 
help both the students and the university library with their problems in
researching problems and storing thesis information.
In the development of a mobile application and web application, the 
researches gathered software methodology, database, programming 
languages, the cost and what sampling method technic to be used. The 
researchers also gathered all the data that they needed to develop the 
system. After that the researchers proceeded to phase one which is to
developed a web application and an Android application that contains 
research topics that can help the students of the LSPU to study better. 
Specifically, it aimed (1) to develop a web application that can maintain the 
content of the android mobile application (2) to develop an android mobile 
application that can use by the students as a thesis archive (3) to develop an 
android mobile application and web application that is user friendly.
After this, researchers would proceed to the second phase which 
aimed to know the acceptability of the users in the develop the “THEREPO: 
Thesis Repository Android Based Application” with the requirements in the 
first phase developed. The researchers need to know the feedback and 
benefits of the THEREPO Mobile Application, It specifically sought to answer 
the following research questions: (1) how to test the develop system (2) how 
to assess the behavior and effectiveness of the developed system (3) how to 
determine the cost analysis for the deployment of the system?",Method
"All studies need reliable information and data to ensure that all the 
facts and knowledge is might to keep the legitimacy of information intact. The 
researchers have used the following methods to collect data.
Library Research
The researchers did a library research in order to conceptualize the
project idea, proponents needed to read literatures and thesis books about 
different studies with regard to technology and I.T. projects. The information 
the researchers got from researching in the library was made as references 
and guide in conducting study and writing thesis.
Internet Research
Internet Research is helpful for the researchers in searching project 
ideas and technology. By Internet Research, the researchers were able to cite 
articles about the study being conducted. Also via internet, the researchers 
may get ways and guides in developing the android application.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interview in LSPU-SCC Library where 
they gathered the data by asking questions to get the needed information 
from the staff. Also the researchers interviewed the students of the university 
to get their impression to the develop system.Population of the Study
The respondents of the study were taken from LSPU Santa Cruz 
Campus from the different Collegesand also the students and Staff of the 
Library. The researchers selected the respondents of this study in which the
mobile application and web application will be used.
The respondents of the study were taken from LSPU Library Staffs 
from Sta.Cruz Main Campus, and also students of the university. All these 
participants were selected through Purposive Sampling Method. The 
respondents would evaluate and asses the proposed system by answering 
the given questionnaires.",Result
"It discusses the presentation, analysis, and interpretation of the data. 
The data are presented in accordance with the statement of the problem. 
The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the 
survey questioner for the library staffs and students of the Laguna State 
Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus. This was the result acquired in the 
necessary data determined if the study achievedpresented here is the 
usefulness and the effectiveness of the system.",Discussion
