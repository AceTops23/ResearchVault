"Information has always been an organization’s central resource. But 
poor information management often contribute as a problem on an 
organization performance. Data records have economic, legal, risk management and competitive values, hence needs to be operational and 
organize. With the advent of technology, computers and smart phones have 
indeed become indispensable in our society. Task and activities will become 
easier with the help of this device as a tool for a user-friendly interface system 
of storing and sorting massive information.
Public Cemetery is a vital place in every town. Aside from the fact that 
it has the remains of deceased people, it also tells the tales of the town history. 
It is where people gather to visit and commemorate their dead love ones. In 
fact, there is even a holiday called All Saints Day and All Souls day specially 
created for this purpose.
Like any other organization, public cemetery has massive records of 
data and information. The current method of keeping, recording and retrieving 
information is still patterned from the old conventional method which often 
lack procedures for effective systematic control of their information record. 
As a result, they keep some records too long, spend too much to store it, waste 
time looking for misplaced information, risk penalties for non- compliance 
with record keeping regulations and fail to protect mission-critical information 
from harm.
With the Covid-19 Pandemic at hand, face to face consultation and data 
gathering is not advisable, hence the researchers resort to use social media 
platforms such as chat messages to communicate and attend to clients concerns 
and SMS notification for remind them(relatives) the payment of rented tomb.
After careful evaluation and consultation, the researchers find out that 
Civil Registrar has difficulties in storing records and tracking Public Cemetery 
files. Researchers propose a record management system that store and retrieve 
cemetery data in a secured database to be access by the Civil Registrar’s office 
only. People can then request information involving public cemetery matters 
such as list of deceased people and their grave yard location via Chat message 
as tool to communicate with the Civil Registrar’s office. Thus the aim of this 
study is to provide a data-based system for the Civil Registrar that will store 
and locate the records and details of public cemetery in the tip of their 
fingertips. ",Introduction
"Santa Cruz is the capital of Laguna Province. The town is composed 
of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. 
Although in the influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz the progress is 
continues in their ways. Sta. Cruz is classified as a first-class municipality 
through different advertisements and establishments that are located in this 
municipality. The new municipal administration is headed by Mayor Egay San 
Luis. Santa Cruz has been one of the seats of the provincial government since 
1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the 
entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, 
commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly 
rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. The town is composed of 
twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are classified as urban.
The municipality of Santa Cruz has thirty-two agencies; one of these 
agencies is the Office of the Mayor, who asks help of the Civil Registrar to 
develop a solution to the current situation in the Public Cemetery. The Civil 
Registrar Office is under of Engr. Laudemer San Juan who is responsible for 
approval of all enhancement or changes in the cemetery. The Public Cemetery 
of Sta. Cruz is located at Barangay Calios and has an area of 16,751 square 
meters. The cemetery has a six blocks apart from the intimate apartment. The 
office handles all the Government records of vital events like birth certificates, 
marriage contracts, and death certificates. The six blocks are taxable and the 
apartment is free for those who cannot afford the payment of the burial. In 
every five years, the family of the deceased must report to the office for paying 
the rent to extend the contract of the tomb. That public cemetery needs a 
system that can easily communicate and help the possible clients and payers 
to get the particular information regarding the requirements and also 
information of their relatives who are buried in this cemetery. 
The current process of the Public Cemetery is the method of recording 
information manually, of the name of the deceased and the name of payer. All 
that requirements compensate manually. The possibility to lose the documents 
that they passed in their office is totally 100%. Through this problem, our 
system that we proposed helps the Civil Registrar to effectively manage all 
that documents and easily retrieve all the data from the database of the 
system. The office has also needed some requirements, which the family must 
submit.",Method

data gathered in the public cemetery of Sta. Cruz, Laguna. The researchers 
conducted a quota sampling to evaluate the system and to get the statistical 
performance.Data Collection Method
Data collection is the process of gathering data and information to 
complete evaluation of a plan in order to identify the system needed to resolve 
the researcher problem for the development of the system.Library Research
Researchers gather information and ideas from different books to learn 
different methods on how to develop a system that include in recording 
and management of a large data and to gain some techniques of how to 
develop a system with an interactive way for communication.
? Online Research
Researchers used the internet to search and develop a new form of idea 
from some website or by reading some article that will be used to the proposed 
project to find more information and improve the researcher’s knowledge of 
the study.
? Interview
The researcher conducted a personal interview to the Civil Registrar 
office and with those involved and could help learn more about needs of Public
