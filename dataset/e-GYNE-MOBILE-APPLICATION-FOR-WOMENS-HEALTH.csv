"The world is changing in a dramatic phase in view of the fact that change 
is inevitable, and humans need to adapt to this kind of changes. Technology has 
been a powerful influence in today’s century. Out of the industries that innovation 
assumes a pivotal part in, healthcare is a standout amongst the most essential. 
Technological innovations include the incorporation of mobile phones in the 
healthcare industry in order to continue to provide physicians with new ways to 
disseminate the quality of care to their patients and improve the state of global 
healthcare. Through technology’s integration with areas like medical 
telecommunications, the medical industry and patients around the world continue 
to benefit. Smartphone technology appears to hold great promise in the future in 
terms of conveying wellbeing conduct changes.
The introduction of smartphones has greatly impacted many fields, 
including medicine. The use of mobile devices by healthcare professionals 
(HCPs) has transformed many aspects of clinical practice. Information and 
communication technology is becoming a natural part of healthcare both for 
delivering and giving accessibility to healthcare for people with chronic illness 
living at home. Mobile devices have become commonplace in healthcare 
settings, leading to rapid growth in the development of medical software 
applications for these platforms. The rapid integration of mobile devices into 
clinical practice has, in part, been driven by the rising availability of medical 
software applications. One major motivation driving the widespread adoption of mobile devices by HCPs has been the need for better communication and 
information resources at the point of care. The growing importance that mobile 
devices have in daily life has also reached healthcare and medicine. This is 
making the paradigm of healthcare change and the concept of mobile health 
(mHealth) more relevant, whose main essence is the application.
Disseminating health and medical information on the internet can improve 
knowledge transfer from health professionals to the population and help 
individuals to maintain and improve their health. There are currently several 
medical mobile applications that directly target the general population with the 
aim of providing information about health problems, self-care, and prevention. 
However, this new technology also hides several shortcomings, such as: (i) 
unreliable medical information available on the Internet; (ii) difficulty in finding, 
understanding and trustworthy information; (iii) lack of access for the 
unconnected population; and (iv) the potential for harm and risks of over consumption. To be able to overcome these dangers, it is important that public 
health practitioners and health professionals be involved in the design, 
dissemination, and evaluation of mobile-based health and medical information. 
The need to develop this mobile application is to lessen the overstatement and 
ensure quality and reliable information that websites and existing mobile 
application lack provide to its users. This mobile application guarantees reliable
and valuable medical information since the content of the mobile application is 
from experts specifically medical specialists in this case Obstetrician

"The rapid development of medical information on the Internet raises the 
issue of its quality and of potential dangers related to its erroneous or unsuitable 
use. Due to a large number of health-related applications and online health 
information, it is difficult to understand if that information came from credible 
sources. Based on the pre-assessment survey done by the proponents, the 
survey basically aimed to determine the veracity of the following: (1) that some 
women adhere to health-related mobile applications, (2) that some women still 
support the development of new health-related mobile applications. 
Smartphone medical applications have a major role to play in women's
health with their roles being very broad, ranging from improving health behaviors 
to undertaking personalized tests. There is also growing interest in harnessing 
smartphone apps to promote behavior change. These provide a unique 
opportunity to help users stay healthy, while potentially playing a key role in 
helping to prevent disease onset. Women have unique health issues. Mobile 
technologies have the potential to bridge systemic gaps needed to improve 
access to and use of health services, particularly among underserved 
populations. Mobile Health (mHealth) Application aims to capitalize on the rapid 
uptake of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health 
system efficiency and health outcomes. Over the past decade, global enthusiasm 
and the interest of development agencies, researchers, and policymakers have 
led to the rapid proliferation of mHealth solutions throughout developed and 
developing countries. As a result of the explosion in mHealth technology, manypatients are turning to alternate sources of information, such as their smartphone 
to manage their health. The power and appeal of this relatively new, interactive, 
convenient information source cannot be underestimated; it is transforming the 
delivery of health education as we know it. It is critical that those seeking to 
access electronic reproductive health information discover information in this 
format that is accurate, up to date, and evidence-based should they choose to do 
so. Overall the number of mobile medical applications developed specifically for 
aspects of women's health is rising but there is much yet to be done. Clearly 
more gender-specific, personalized apps are needed, for example, for 
reproductive health issues.
Getting sick seems a lot more stressful now that we have the internet. 
People can research their symptoms, but inevitably they’ll fall down a rabbit hole 
of illnesses that are so unlikely, every search will turn up a life-threatening 
disease. The general problem of this study is that the scientific quality of 
information is difficult to evaluate by the public for whom the most important thing 
is to be able to find the information they need, to understand it and to apply it. 
Once the information is found, and assuming that it is valid and complete, users 
must understand it and put it into practice. At present, most medical-based 
websites and mobile applications present technical information to a population 
unfamiliar with medical literature. In addition, the difficulty with technical terms 
and the required reading skill level is also a problem.",Method
"Population of the Study
The respondents of the study are composed of the Laguna State 
Polytechnic University female students from different colleges, interviewed 
Ob/Gyne’s and IT Experts. They were surveyed in order to gain useful data for 
the research.
Data Collection Method
The proponents used different fact-finding techniques to collect data from 
the Obstetrician and women that were used in creating and designing of e-Gyne
mobile application. 
To gather primary and secondary data and information needed in the 
development of the study, the proponents conducted data gathering activities 
and methods and those are as follows:
Brainstorming- The proponents shared and discussed different ideas, 
suggestions and understanding about the study. 
Interview- The proponents performed interviews through the form of 
questionnaire with the Ob/Gyne’s to gather medical information and data about 
the different minor gynecological illnesses and the head of GAD for the 
respondents.
Survey- The proponents conducted a survey through the form of questionnaire 
to gather information and insights of women if they adhere to health related 
mobile applications and still support the development of new health related 
mobile applications.
Library Research- The proponents did a prudent library research that gave an 
average amount of previous studies that guided the proponents on the said 
study.
Internet Research- Because there are information that are not available in the 
library the proponents conducted research on online websites that helped
improve the study

"This section presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discussed if the 
study entitled “e-Gyne: Mobile Application for Women’s Health” had satisfied and 
fulfilled the needs of its intended user.
The researchers used survey questionnaires for the testing of the system. 
Researchers used the questionnaire TAM for the LSPU female students and ISO 
25010 for the IT Experts and Ob/Gyne. The reason why the study utilized two 
sets of questionnaire is that, the TAM is for the non-IT professionals to test the 
acceptance level of the developed mobile application and ISO 25010 is for the IT 
expert to determine the quality of the developed mobile application. Both of these 
were done to acquire the necessary data to determine the efficiency and the 
effectiveness of the system and ensure that it has fulfilled the needs of the client.
Different questions were given to each category of users. The researchers 
used a five-point Likert scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree and 
Strongly Disagree) on the survey questionnaires.
