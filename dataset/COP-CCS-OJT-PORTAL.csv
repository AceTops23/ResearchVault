"The use of information and communication technology has been growing 
since the invention of computers and internet. These technologies enable 
students to learn independent of time and location. However, learners need 
computer and internet access to acquire knowledge. Most of the time carrying 
a computer and finding an internet access point are the major constraints for 
learners. Mobile communication technologies can support such situations and 
they can prepare more flexible learning environments for learners. As web 
technologies advance, internet users become dissatisfied with services 
provided in a normal website. The user needs a place that brings all the 
information relevant to him together, instead of information posted in different 
places with hopes that someone will see it.
One of the technology today is a web portal that serve as gateway or 
main entry point on the internet to a specific field-of-interest or an industry. Web 
portal provides essential services such as search engines, email, and 
personalized content. OJT portal will be able to benefit the student and teacher. 
The web portal can increase and easier communication with faculty, while the 
faculty can communicate real time and instant access to information for 
advising their students. 
A Web portal is designed to help people in disseminating information in 
a very easy way. This portal makes network resource (application, database, 
etc.) available to end users. The users can access the portal via web browsers 
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) phone and other devices. Portal includes 
network enabling service such as e-mail, chat rooms and calendars that interact 
seamlessly with other applications. The Web portal offers the user a broad array 
of information, arranged in a way that is most convenient for the user to access. 
Mobile devices and wireless technologies are making a large impact on 
our lives. Mobile devices especially have been widely used in the last few years, 
and recent developments in wireless technologies have provided some new 
solutions to modes of connectivity. In recent time, there have been dramatic 
changes in the field of mobile devices with the goal of improving the mobile 
environment. Companies that develop mobile applications are in the process of 
continuously evolving their products for creating tools that satisfy the 
customers’ needs even more comprehensively and better. Mobile devices have 
become an important part of everyday life. Improvements in mobile devices 
have made them appropriate for learning. Mobile technologies have promoted 
a new learning style known as mobile learning. Which is the use of mobile or 
wireless devices for the purpose of learning while on the move, and with the 
help of the mobile devices or android devices, they can easily form a portal that 
can be helpful for the people.
The advancement of technology introduced the most effective tools for 
fast and better communication; the computer, mobile phones and the internet. 
In lot of situation, technology is being used as a tool in making documentation 
and transferring information to everyone because everybody has access to the 
internet. People now live in a time where communication technology is 
improving and sometimes, they become more dependent with this. It has been 
a big part of everyone’s life and affected the way people live. Today, almost everyone can access the internet to communicate and to transfer information. 
And because of its accessibility, they tend to use the computer in getting, 
sharing information and can easily transfer information and documents. 
Web portal is a web based application that enables effective student 
teacher interaction. It is a user friendly, Graphical User interface (GUI) based 
application that will help users for storing, retrieving and sharing resources 
online. It provides facilities such as online assignment, uploading and 
downloading files.
A web portal is most often specially designed for websites that brings 
information together from diverse sources in a uniform way. Usually, each 
information source gets its designated area on the page for displaying 
information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display.
This proposed system is about Web Portal that will help the students to 
be updated in their submittals schedule, announcement and thru this the 
students can easily pass their requirements on-time by simply uploading it to 
the web portal.",Introduction
"This thesis presents the background in terms of new technologies in 
handheld devices. Some of the students in College of Computer Studies are 
having or applying their OJT far from the school or outside the country because 
they wanted to know more and have some experiences with IT community. This 
cause confict of schedule between the students and the adviser. The 
researchers came up with the idea to create an OJT portal for CCS because 
they tend to use Facebook and other social media accounts for posting and uploading the formats of the requirements of the OJT students. The client also 
have a limited time for them to meet the students that are taking the OJT. The 
instructor would announce the format for the students to know what are the 
formats or where to download the formats of the requirements.
The researchers are able to create a common objective which to develop 
and test “COP: CCS OJT Portal” that would be great help to students and the
teacher. These research question were formulated to help with the 
development of the study: (1) how to develop a module for the CCS OJT 
students? (2) what tools will be used in developing a web based system? (3) 
how to assess the effectiveness of the system.
In the improvement of the system, some components are considered 
such as materials to be used, it’s structure, the user interface design and the 
cost to be spent. The researchers have completed identifying these 
components. The first phase of the study specifically aimed to (1) develop a 
module that will help the user to save time for their job. It also helped the student 
to easily submit their accomplishment report to their professor even if they are 
far away from school; (2) to identify the applicable programming language and 
database for the development of the system; lastly (3) to create a survey that 
was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
After the study was developed, the researchers aimed to answer the 
research question. It contained the objective identified from the preceding 
phase of the study. The researchers recognized the general problem, how to 
certify the effectiveness of the developed CCS OJT Portal, it specifically aimed
to answer the following research questions: (1) how to test the developed CCS 
OJT Portal? (2) how to assess the behavioral intention of the users in the 
developed system? (3) how to determine the cost analysis for the deployment 
of the system?",Method
"The researchers got the analysis on what are the problems that they 
encountered during the research, designing and data gathering process. 
The following instruments were used by the researchers in order to make 
the study feasible.
The researchers used materials such as books, manuscripts, thesis and 
previous related studies to help make the study feasible. The internet also made 
a big contribution in providing sufficient data needed by the proponents. 
The researchers used a Fact finding technique to collect data and 
information needed to develop the system like observation which gives 
researchers the additional perspective and better understanding about the 
manual operations. It also allowed the researchers to discover accurate 
information and data needed to be added on the system.
For them to be able to gather information needed in the study, the 
following methods were applied:
Interview 
The researchers conducted an interview in College of Computer Studies 
where they gathered the data by asking questions to get the needed information 
from the interviewee.
Internet Research 
The use of the computer and internet helps the researchers in discussing 
the different aspects of the proposed system. It enables the evaluation of the 
hardware and all the materials needed in the study. It provides additional ideas 
in the development of the proposed system. The internet also supplies 
information by providing other proposed study that in which it supports the 
system by means of function and principle. The World Wide Web helps the 
proponents to accomplish the supporting documents for the creation of the 
study.
Library Research
The library is one of the main sources of information for the researchers 
in gathering information. The proponents read previous studies in the library to 
help in terms of related data which are essential in building theories in 
developing the proposed system. The information gathered from the related 
help in building the supporting documents for the proposed system.
Consultant
With the help of an advisers, the proponents learn and acquire more 
ideas about the proposed study. The components and devices that are needed 
are also discussed to be able for the proponents to know how each of them 
works. Coding examples for the system are also taken up.
The Thesis Adviser helped the researchers in documentation of the 
proposed system. The Thesis Adviser gave advice on how to document the 
system in a correct way. The Thesis Adviser helped the researchers gather 
information and gave ideas where to gather data and information.
