"Technology helps to enhance the quality of lives everyone has. It has 
many roles in our daily routine. It transforms not only the way individuals conduct 
their communications to each other, but also the very essence of what it means 
to be a human being in society. The technology today affects our way of 
socializing to each other because many people would rather use technology to 
talk to someone. As the time goes by, individuals experience different new things 
because of this millennial change we don’t usually see the children play in the 
streets because they rather be in their house holding their gadgets. Internet is the 
most important innovation since the development of the technology it brings a 
new way of living for everyone and technology can also be applied in different 
forms like in medical and health care. 
A mobile application is a computer program designed to run on a mobile 
device such as a phone or tablet. Mobile applications often stand in contrast 
to desktop applications that run on desktop computers, and with web 
applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile 
device. Mobile apps were originally offered for general productivity and 
information retrieval, including email, calendar, contacts, stock market and 
weather information. However, public demand and the availability of developer 
tools drove rapid expansion into other categories, such as those handled by 
desktop application software packages. As with other software, the explosion in 
number and variety of application made discovery a challenge, which in turn ledto the creation of a wide range of review, recommendation, and cure sources, 
including blogs, magazines, and dedicated online app-discovery services.",Introduction
"The Philippine Red Cross was officially born in 1947, but with roots that 
traces back to the revolutionary days, the Philippine Red Cross has truly become
the premier humanitarian organization in the country, committed to provide 
quality life-saving services that protect the life and dignity especially of indigent 
Filipinos in vulnerable situations. The Philippine Red Cross provides six major 
services: Blood Services, Disaster Management Services, Safety Services, 
Health Services, Social Services, Red Cross Youth and Volunteer Services. All of 
them embody the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Movement – humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary 
service, unity and universality. These values guide and inspire all Red Cross staff 
and volunteers, to whom being a Red Crosser is more than just a philosophy but 
a way of life.
As the generation goes by the technology also improves in every aspect. 
The people’s necessities also increase and that will be one of the reasons 
improve the current study. As the technology grows the functions of different 
roles of the system also increases. The proposed study includes different 
functions to improve the services of the Philippine Red Cross by developing a 
mobile application that the hospitals and Red Cross can use in their transactions.
The researchers conducted a pre-assessment survey to the blood donors 
and some of the Red Cross members to identify the problems they encountered 
as a donor and a member. One of the major problems they encounter is the 
scheduling time because it is slow and they are not aware how and where they 
can donate blood. Another problem they encounter is they don’t know if they are 
capable to donate blood. Blood requestors who experienced blood transfusion to 
know the process and also the problems they encountered. One of the problems 
they encountered is there are many process for seeking blood donors for the 
specific blood needed. It is also stated by one of the blood requestors that there 
is no efficient process of seeking blood and blood donors. One of the blood 
requestors said that they doesn’t have enough time to wait for donors so they 
seek for a solution that leads them to post on Facebook that they needed a blood 
but only friends who donated already responded. In the end they don’t get 
enough blood donation that makes the blood requestors weaker.",Method
"Data Collection Method
In order to gather the data and information needed in the study, the 
researchers used different activities and methods, one of which was 
brainstorming. In brainstorming, the researchers focused on gathering different 
ideas. Discussion about each thought will also be done to bring more ideas, 
make ideas more clear, or even solve the existing problem of the client.
The following tools are used in order to make the study feasible:
Interview
The researchers interview the Philippine Red Cross Laguna Chapter 
Administrator to know the problems they encountered in terms of communicating 
with the blood requestors in terms of blood donation for certain blood requestors
and how they interact with people and volunteer blood donors and the conflicts 
discovered was the lack of blood donations because only family, friends and 
relatives are the people who only donates and the blood requestors needs it consecutively while the donors cannot donate until 2-3 months interval so this 
lead the researchers for this study.
Brainstorming 
The proponent think and list all of the possible ideas for the solution of a 
problem. This method can help the researchers to visualize a plan on how to 
accomplish all the data gathering method for the information that will be used in 
developing the application. The researchers also used brainstorming as a 
strategy to determine what the possible conflicts are that is needed to be solved 
before and within the time needed.
Internet Research
The proponents do the internet research to expand their knowledge when 
it comes to as their reference and guide during the process of the research. The 
proponents also use internet to search and gather some articles, literature and 
studies that is related to the developed study.
Library Research 
The proponents made a library research to gather data or information for 
the related studies which helps them to gain more knowledge on what kind of 
improvement they need to improve on their research.
Observation 
The proponents used observation to know more about the problems they 
encountered using their current process. Through this it helps the researcher to 
gain more information about the blood requestors and donors. 
",Result
"In this section, the researchers show the results of the developed system
”SaveLife: Connecting Blood Donors Mobile Application” as stated by the 
respondents in terms of the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude 
towards using, actual use, intentions to use, voluntariness and experience. The 
data collected from the respondents were analyzed, tabulated and interpreted to 
determine the difference of student’s performance in pre-test and post-test.
