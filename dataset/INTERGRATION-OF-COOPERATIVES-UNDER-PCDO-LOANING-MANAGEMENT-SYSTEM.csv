"A cooperative is a very know organization everywhere in the Philippines as a 
place where do people ran and borrow money in a small interest in payment as for the 
reason of the lack of finance. Cooperative organizations basically work to provide 
assistance and help in terms of money, agricultural tools, and etc. The main purpose of 
any cooperative organization is to provide service to its active members. 
Among of all of cooperatives there are only few who uses technology as a 
practice of their works but mostly estimated of 70-90 percent of the cooperatives in the 
Laguna or Philippines uses manually or old school method of recording, retrieving, and 
searching of the past and present records about their cooperative, in which there was a 
big disadvantage of using it, as compared of using of an online system which is 
processed and generated by the computer itself with only the command of each users of 
the system who are the Cooperatives Admins even the members itself.
The ‘Integration of the Cooperatives Loaning Management System” aims to help 
PCDO, Cooperative, and the loaners. The system would organize schedule of PCDO 
and Cooperative to lessen the time of scheduling the seminars to immediately response 
to its request and to provide solution to the problem of the cooperative. The system also 
would manage and organize the records of all other cooperative and to store in one 
database. And the system would allow the loaners monitors their account from the 
cooperative to be open in the browsers. The study would focus on the credit cooperative 
in the district 4. And the system would allow the loaners monitors their account from 
the cooperative to be open in the browsers.
",Introduction
"The Provincial Cooperative Development Office (PCDO), Located at Sta 
Cruz, Laguna which aimed to help, improve, and develop different Cooperatives 
(Credit, Consumers, Producers, Agrarian Reform, Service, Agriculture, and 
Multipurpose Cooperatives) at the province of Laguna, they conducted Seminars 
every once a month to be participated by the officers of the Cooperatives especially 
the Head Manager to teach all the cooperatives in Laguna to be a good and well structured cooperative that would lend a money to all the qualified citizens who 
barrow’s money to them. The purpose of the PCDO conference that they’ve done is 
to avoid the bigger problems of the cooperatives that will possibly happen. The 
PCDO’s geographical position has been a variable of the different cooperatives here 
in Laguna, which resulted the large number of its members, 410 Cooperatives is the 
total population registered in PCDO which included the different types of 
Multipurpose Cooperatives. 
The “Republic act 3765: Truth in Lending Act” which stated that the 
Cooperative must follow of implementing a 1% of interest to any amount of loan 
that the loaners borrow. And it must be a diminishing of 1% interest which means 
that the interest must vary to the remaining balance of the loaner. 
Based on our observation, many files and documents from the current and 
past data were scattered throughout the office and the cabinets, so it took time to find 
some documents if someone is needed to have it. In paying loans, the main problem 
is the updating the status of the loaner. In our interview with the secretary, a person 
is already paid their loan but, the ledger that the collectors had must be updated to 
the office, but they didn’t do it immediately resulting to have a misunderstanding to 
the cooperative office and the loaner. In the office record, the person didn’t pay on the month or week they must pay the fact that he/she pay it accordingly. They don’t 
have a software that would help them in keeping the records safely and updating the 
ledger and the book easily, for the way of their updating the record that they are in 
manual process, on the main records that they have. 
There are different problems that the PCDO and Credit Cooperatives 
encountered in the processes in operating their services. 1.) The PCDO takes a long 
time in replying to the request of seminars each cooperative for the PCDO still need 
to match their own schedule with the cooperatives. 2.) Cooperatives management of 
records is not in good situation that causes loss of records, and took a long period of 
time of searching of the past records. 3) The lack of management of records causes 
an effect to the cooperative’s members and it causes a double payment for not 
updating the book even if the loaner had already paid. 4.) The cooperative can’t view 
the previous record of the its new members and to check if the loaners have no debt 
at other cooperative.",Method
"Population of the study
The target populations of this study were respondents directly from the District 
4 in Laguna Cooperatives including the PCDO, General Managers, Secretaries, and the 
loaners that was being interviewed during the preliminary investigation. This sampling 
method was conducted where each member of the population had chosen to be part of 
the sample representing from District 4. 
Table 1. Respondents of the Study. This table shows the population of the respondents 
in evaluating the developed system. Formula in finding the percentage:
(???????????????????? =
(??)(100)
33
 where X is the number of the given respondents).
Data Collection Instruments 
The researchers used various type of method in order to collect data and 
information for the development of the research study. The methods are listed below:
Questionnaire: The researchers used questionnaires and give it to the members 
of the cooperative in order to have more insights from the member of the cooperative 
without interviewing them one by one, this was used during preliminary investigation. 
Interview: The researchers gather data through face-to-face interview from
different managers and people inside a cooperative with consent and approval from the 
cooperative management, asking questions that needed in order to have sufficient 
information for the research, this was used during preliminary investigation.
Audio Recorder: Throughout the interview the researchers used audio recording 
to be able to track and revert information in cased it is needed. 
Observation: the researchers also watch and observed what the environment would look 
like and especially how the cooperatives operate, thus, helping the researcher to have a 
perspective in a wider view. And help provides highly detailed information about the 
natural process of each cooperatives. 
Internet Research: The researchers also used internet research especially in this 
case where the project will be a web-based system, it is also the most efficient way to 
have all the information from different studies and sources during the study. 
Library Research: The researchers studied and read other related capstone 
project from previous years related to the cooperatives system and data management 
system in LSPU Library, this was used during preliminary investigation.Consultation: The researchers consult people like IT experts and advisers to 
better understand and find a solution on how and what are the best solutions in building 
the system to have a better output all throughout the study.
Statistical Treatment
In order to analyze the data, the researcher gather data through the use of 
Statistical Treatment. The researcher used Weighted Mean and the Standard Deviation.
",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis, results of the study and interpretation of the 
test results acquired from testing and surveys by the researchers. It also discusses if the 
“Integration of Cooperative under PCDO Loaning Management System” has fulfilled
