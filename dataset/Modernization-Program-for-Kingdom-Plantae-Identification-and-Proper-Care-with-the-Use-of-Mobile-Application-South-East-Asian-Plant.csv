"In this chapter the researchers will present their study and its resemblance to 
other studies. The researchers also stated the problem in the study.
Globally, mobile technology became more gradually in demand to use as 
Information Communication Technologies (ICT) choose this technology to produce 
services and solutions. Making new mobile application for plants give planters an 
opportunity to improve in their work. Mobile is not only for communication it also 
became a tool for agricultural use that would help planters to be more productive. Plant 
mobile app are fast-growing and been in the mainstream in technological development. 
The significance of information technology in a plant mobile application is that it 
can be a more efficient way of adding, selecting, and storing of the plant’s data. It can 
also make the users more productive on taking care of plants.
Here in the Philippines, most of the people are not engaged on planting and it 
can’t be taken for granted. This study aims to educate and have a user-friendly platform 
to use by the Filipinos. The plant mobile app will be allowing the users to maximize 
time and efficiency. The study seeks to develop a mobile application that will be 
beneficial to all plant lovers to boost their enthusiasm in the field of gardening. It aims 
to improve knowledge, increase awareness and add up interest in learning about plants. 
Its design is to promote the understanding of a vast variety of plants; its identity, 
classification and proper care. The development of the mobile app will lead to a better 
outcome for our country.
",Introduction
"The mobile application provides a lot of information about plants, it also can be 
a great help to people who’s interested on planting. In terms of mental health, planting
has also been shown to decrease the risk of dementia and as a type of therapy for those 
already suffering from it. . 
In the old days many people are interested on planting plant and flowers but later 
on many Filipino forgot the benefits and happiness that a plant can give. Due to this,
many of us could not recognize different types of plants.
However during the COVID 19 pandemic some of the Plantito's and Plantita's 
in Sta Cruz Laguna found themselves having interest having interest on planting plants 
again to reduce the boredom and stress that the pandemic is causing. Find a distraction 
and also de-stress from the anxiety that brought by the pandemic. By the help of interest 
many Filipino can access different plat form of application so that this study is came up 
because during this pandemic the planting of plants and flowers arise.
In the arise of Plantito's and Plantita's during the pandemic these are the 
problems that arise that the researchers identify and analyze their study such as (1) Lack 
of information in the type of plant, (2) Where does the plants belong (in category), (3) 
Lack of knowledge on which family the plant is included, (4) Absence of knowledge 
on taking care of plants.
Upon conducting the technology gap analysis, the researchers found out that 
other applications available on market do not have the same features of our app: (a) 
plant information and online database search; (b) complete plant propagation 
information; (c) comprehensive plant care tips; (d) comment feature. Based on the 
analysis the app PictureThis does not have plant categories of indoor and outdoor plants 
and their design is not quite user friendly. The PlantNet app has no comment feature
for the users. Lastly, the Plantix app, this mobile app only focuses on how to cure a 
plant disease while the researcher’s app has a lot of care-tips and plant description. In 
short, the Modernization Program for Kingdom Plantae: Identification and Proper Care 
with the Use of Mobile Application have improved features and has a user-friendly 
interface to make the users more engaged other than the said mobile applications.",Method
"Population of the Study
Pertinent data were obtained from Facebook group community called Plantito’s 
and Plantita’s of Manila, Plantito’s and Plantita’s of Philippines and Mayana Lovers
and plant owners online. A community of plant sellers and owners were interviewed by 
the researchers through Facebook because of the pandemic. The researchers chose some 
groups and individuals because they will be the ones who to benefit from the study.
Data Collection Method
The researchers used fact finding technique to collect data and important 
information needed to develop the mobile app like observation that gave the researchers 
additional perspective and better understanding about the Modernization Program for 
Kingdom Plantae: Identification and Proper Care with the use of Mobile Application. 
It also allowed the researchers to discover accurate information and data needed to add 
on the app. 
Interview The interview was conducted by the researcher in a virtual platform to be 
safe in the pandemic. The researchers asked some questions on how to take care a plant 
properly and when is the best time to plant. In place of the researchers, gathering
necessary information, data, and process flow inside and outside the contributory are 
crucial. This involves a virtual contact between the researchers and the contributories. 
Therefore, asking the right price of each plant, the different category of plants and the 
benefits of each plants is a hard matter because of the pandemic situation. 
Library Research The researchers read published books, recent thesis of the College 
of Computer Studies and other related books to researchers’ study.
Consultation The researchers consulted to the professor of CCS to show the progress 
of the researchers.
Observation The researchers conduct an observation to the Plant Seller to fully 
understand the process on how they sell their plant.
Internet Research The researchers use internet research to read published books, 
articles that is related to their study.
Questionnaire The researchers conduct some certain question which was used as an 
interview guide question to their client.
Testing The researchers conducted a testing of the developed mobile app using black 
box testing with a tool which is the test case used by IT professionals to evaluate the 
functionality and features of the developed mobile app. 
Survey The researcher used Technology Acceptance Model with ISO Standard to the 
admin head, office staff and traffic enforcer that will use the developed mobile app to 
acquire the user behaviour and user acceptance toward the developed system and ask 
the respondents recommendations and their opinions about the app that the researcher 
has developed. ",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interference of the data result acquired 
from the surveys conducted by the researchers after the mobile was developed. It also 
discusses if the researcher’s study has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of the client and 
respondents.
