"The ever growing and continuous advancements in technology that are 
happening today can be found in almost anything that helps people improve 
their way of life. These changes are not only limited to things that improves 
the way of life, but are also incorporated into different aspects of life such as
how students are educated, how businesses and employees work, and so 
many more. Technologies that are easily adapted to simple and affordable 
everyday things have certainly changed the lives and workflows of many 
people.
As these technological advancements further develop, many work 
places also incorporate these developments in their companies or offices to 
keep up with the technological trends, improve the security of the personal 
information of their employees as well as the sensitive information of the 
company. Some examples include the usage of face or retinal scanners in 
their offices for the reason of security. Another example is the implementation 
of computer systems for the lessening of workloads for their employees in 
offices such as information systems and record management system. In the 
past, the tasks that are done in offices such as records keeping, and 
organization of information are all done manually and the large amounts of 
paper works and such can cause some burden to the employees and are 
more prone to human error. With the implementation of computer systems in 
the said companies, the possibility of human errors can be reduced. As to any other offices, school offices can also benefit from these 
systems, especially regarding the ones that have an enormous student 
population. Therefore, a system which can accommodate this large number of 
students is needed. Not only should the developed system accommodate the 
students’ needs, but also the needs of the said office. It should keep track of 
important data, and also record very sensitive information.
The way they handle and exchange critical data inside a campus must 
be fast and reliable which will enable them to manage the records more
systematically. This should also apply to personnel that handle sensitive data 
regarding students and keeps records of it. Thus, the researchers in this study 
came up with a concept o1f developing a web based clerical and records 
management system, specifically for the guidance office of the Laguna State 
Polytechnic University, Santa Cruz Campus.",Introduction
"The guidance and counselling of students is an integral component of 
the educational mission of the school. Guidance and counselling services and 
programs promote the personal/social, educational, and career development 
of all students which are all done in person in the guidance counselor’s office, 
where sometimes a student would be shy to talk about his or her problem.
With this in mind, the communication between students and the guidance 
counselor must be secure and fast specifically with the student complaints. 
The clerical services offered by the guidance office are also important 
and is included in the development of the system.
Hence, the researchers conceptualized an efficient and reliable system
in terms of its capability in dealing and keeping of records with sensitive 
information regarding the counseling of the students, student complaints, and 
requests from students to acquire documents like the certificate for good 
moral, and such. The other personnel of the guidance office, which are the 
ones that are responsible for other tasks such as releasing of documents and 
such will also have accounts so that they can input the data and keep records 
of students that has violations, input sensitive information regarding students 
that has or had guidance counseling, and they can also print the requested 
documents of the students.
With these things said, the aim of the study is to design and develop a 
system that will provide the guidance office personnel and guidance counselor
of the Laguna State Polytechnic University, Santa Cruz Campus a tool in 
which they can keep records of students more efficiently and easily, and also 
the students would be able to request documents and send complaints thru 
their account’s interface. The first phase of this study aims to answer the 
following questions: (a) what would be the process flow of the proposed
system to be as effective as how the researchers conceptualized it to be? (b)
what functions should the conceptualized system have for the guidance 
counselor and the guidance office personnel? and (c) what functions should 
the conceptualized system have for the students account?
After the researchers had finished the first phase, the researchers have 
concluded the following: (a) a process flow that was derived from the data 
gathered by the researchers from the guidance office made it possible for the 
users, especially the guidance counselor and guidance office personnel, to be 
effective, (b) the functions for the guidance office staff were made to be 
specific for the tasks that they handle and to ease their workload, and (c) the 
functions for the students were made to help them with the requesting of 
documents that are only requested at the guidance office.
The second phase of the study focused on the evaluation of the study 
and to test the effectiveness of the developed system. The second phase 
sought to answer the following questions: (a) how would the developed 
functions of the system tested? (b) was the formulated process flow for the 
system made it possible for implementation? and (c) how would the system 
be evaluated? ",Method
"The researchers made a various way to solve a problem; they must 
think and observe about the problems that are mostly encountered inside of 
the school. The researchers also explored a deeper analysis about the 
problems that they have encountered during the research. In order to gather 
information needed for the study, the following methods below were applied:
Library Research is used by the researchers to make the 
study feasible. The researchers went to different libraries to gather 
information that can be related to the developed system then analyzed
it if there’s any idea that can be helped to build the system well.
Internet Research is used by the researchers to make the 
study feasible. The researchers searched for a project that can help to 
improve the system that can be found in the internet. All things that 
you want to know is only in the internet, it can help to decide what is 
right to the developed system.
Consultation helped the researchers to know the right thing to 
do with development of the system. The consultant gave their 
suggestions and some advice to help built the system correctly. With 
their suggestions, the researchers can make an idea and analyze it if 
can be fit on the system.
Interviews were done by the researchers with the client that 
helped the researchers to properly know how the circulation of data 
that happens with the developed system. ",Result
"Varying factors and methods where used for the completion of this 
study and development of the system. In this chapter, those factors and 
methods will be discussed. This includes the locale of the study, data 
collection methods, the software methodology and design used, and the 
requirements documentations.
