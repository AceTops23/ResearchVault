"Technology influences the lives of billions of people. Humans depend on 
technology, and the need for more advanced technology keeps on rising. 
Humankind is now almost entirely connected to some form of modern technology, 
which inevitably leads to various positive and negative outcomes. Technology is a 
huge contributor to the well-being of human kind. People grown by using the 
luxuries that technology provides that many would not know how to adapt to the 
traditional and simpler methods. Technology has surely proven itself to be very 
beneficial, if not necessary. Some people may be confused on what exactly 
technology is. Technology is the systematic study of the methods and techniques 
employed in industry, research, agriculture, and commerce. These studies are 
then put to use in order to make daily life much easier. Augmented Reality using 
in studies. It makes the students become more active in the learning process due 
to the interactivity of its participation. Thus, it encourages students to think critically 
and creatively which in turn, improves their experiences and understanding.
There is too many advantage of Augmented Reality in education. 
Augmented Reality have an eye-catching presentation by integrating Augmented 
Reality into your lectures, it’ll capture the attention of the audience. It will have their 
undivided attention because it makes lesson more interactive by making students 
able to access models on their own devices via augmented application. By viewing 
augmented models, the students can gain a better understanding of the concepts 
that they are studying. This is a fun way to engage students and reinforce concepts 
they’ve seen during class lectures. ",Introduction
"Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus, specifically the 
College of Computer Studies are currently using power point presentation, and 
hand-outs as teaching tools. This way of teaching also apply to the subject of 
personal computer Troubleshooting. But it is not enough, because this kind of 
subject needed materials and some spare parts of Computer System Unit for the 
lesson, and that is what the subject is lack. They don’t have enough materials and 
spare parts of Computer System Unit for the whole class. It is essential to the 
subject to have the materials and spare parts of Computer System Unit because 
this subject is more on practical activities. It’s very difficult to manage this kind of 
subject if there’s not enough necessary materials as teaching tool. The professor 
that handling the subject is just giving some handouts about the lesson to the 
students. Because there’s not enough spare parts of Computer System Unit, the 
professor only show the parts in front of everyone to show the parts looks like and 
discuss its function. Because of this problem some students did not take the 
subject seriously. 
The researchers came up with an idea on how to solve the problem using 
only modules and power point presentations for teaching the subject of PC 
Troubleshooting. The problem with the existing system, is that the students are did 
not take the subject seriously and lose of interest about the System Unit because of lack of materials needed for the subject. Students does not give an extra effort 
to familiarize the different parts of System Unit and how it works.
The researchers developed an interactive and educational mobile 
application to get the attention of the students and will be useful to fill the lack of 
materials in the subject. The mobile application entitled “Advance Learning for 
CCS-SCC Using Augmented Reality and Module Support” will improve the system 
and solve the problem of the subject with the use of mobile phone and the module 
designated for the mobile application as a teaching tool.",Method
"The researchers used several methods in collecting data such as 
researching in library reading previous thesis and surfing through the use of 
internet, collecting and comparing related studies and literature that somehow 
similar to study. The researchers conducted an interview to the professor that 
handle the subject of PC Troubleshooting of the College of Computer Studies to 
be able to gather information about the problems that they were encounter during 
actual process of the activity. The following instruments were used in order to make 
the study feasible. 
Interview 
Interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answer were 
given. It usually take place face to face and in person, although modern 
technologies such as internet have enabled conversations to happen in which 
parties are separated geographically. The researchers interviewed the instructor 
for gathering information about the procedure of the manual process of teaching 
and also the problem that being encountered using the manual process in Laguna 
State Polytechnic University, College of Computer Studies.
Library Research 
Library research involves the step by step process used to gather 
information in order to write a paper, create presentation, or complete a project. 
The library serve as the sources of information for the researchers. Library had a 
lot of thesis, journals and published books that help the researchers to have a 
guideline in making their study feasible.
Internet Research 
In gathering information, the internet serves as the most usable sources.
Browsing in the internet gives the researchers more explanation about the study 
and helps in understanding some information related to the study. It helps the 
researchers about creating some codes and collecting some related literature and 
studies. ",Result
"Augmented Reality with module allows and support the students to have a 
better learning outcome. Students and professors does not need to provide any 
learning material about the said project. It contains 3D images that can show the 
components of the system unit, this application shows on how to assemble and 
disassemble the system unit and it also contains voice recognition for the students 
to know the specific parts of the system unit and for them to know on how the parts 
of system unit works.",Discussion
