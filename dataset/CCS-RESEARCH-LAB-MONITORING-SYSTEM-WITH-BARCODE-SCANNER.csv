"In this so-called computer age, almost all people from various ages know 
how to use computer. Some uses it for educational purposes, communication, 
online games and most especially in business and transactions. With its new 
invention people could easily participate in some activities, hence, believing that 
there are negative impact for social relationship. The point here is, technology 
have an important role in this century and gives many benefits for societies. 
Besides, technology is accessible for everyone such as teenagers, young 
people, adults and businessmen. Some effects also occurs for people either 
they could have benefits or drawback. Uses should control technology for 
supporting their activities and not let technology control them because 
technology is created merely to facilitate people’s lives.
With the combined power of computers and the knowledge of a 
programmer, they can build a computer-based system like automating a 
manual system such as recording and monitoring. Monitoring is the regular 
observation and recording of activities taking place in a project or program. It is 
a process of routinely gathering information on all aspects of the project to 
improve a automating system effectively there are various devices that made 
to provide those system accurate, reliable and efficient system. 
A barcode reader or barcode scanner is an electronic device that can 
read and output printed barcodes to a computer. Using a barcode system 
reduces people’s time. It takes only minutes to master the hand-held scanner 
for reading barcodes. Furthermore, peoples do not have to gain familiarity with an entire inventory or pricing procedure. This also make their training less 
expensive, since they do not have to be paid for extra training time, and another 
people does not have to be compensated for training them. Also barcodes 
eliminate the possibility of human error. The occurrence of errors for manually 
entering data is significantly higher than that of barcodes. A barcode scanner is 
fast and reliable, and takes infinitely less time than entering data by hand.",Introduction
"People slowly realized the importance of computer. It can speed up 
communication even in remote areas and can be a mean of transferring data 
for business needs. Through the advancement of technology today the work of 
will be efficient and reliable. 
CCS Research Laboratory is under the College of Computer Studies 
which is aiming to have continual improvements and be a comfortable
Research Laboratory in the whole University. One step to achieve this objective 
is to have a computer based system. It is indeed important and helpful for the 
Research Laboratory to be one step higher from what system it has now into 
having a more progressive monitoring system.
The Research Laboratory is managed by the Dean of the College and 
the student assistant that monitors the Research Laboratory regularly. 
Recording of books and borrower’s information as well as the transaction is 
done manually or in a paper based. There are multiple disadvantages of using 
such system as losing of data because it may be misplaced, torn or 
waterlogged. It also cause inaccurate recording of data. Ever since the 
Research Laboratory of College of Computer Studies has opened started serving the student, it is the most visited area of the department most especially 
for students and instructor. There are a lot of reasons why the students want to 
go there and one of the main reasons is to that they gain more knowledge.
Throughout the development of the system, different fundamentals are 
measured such as the changes that the researchers need to apply on the new 
computer-based system, the user’s interface design and the things that the 
researchers needed in making the system. During the first phase of the study it
aimed to design and develop a computer-based borrowing and returning of 
books using the barcode scanner to support a faster way of recording and 
monitoring of books in a more secured way. Specifically, it aimed to (1) develop 
a system that could monitor and record the borrowed and returned books in the
research laboratory which will improve its security; (2) to develop and design a 
research laboratory system based on a barcode scanner that could organize
and have an accurate book recording; and (3) to develop a system that can 
identify the information of the borrowers.",Method
"The researchers used different fact finding techniques in able to collect 
data from the CCS Research Lab that would be used in creating and designing 
of system.
Interview - The researchers conducted an interview at the hospital to gather 
the data needed. The researchers ask some questions to the students of the 
CCS Research Lab and to the dean to get the data in able to build the 
proposed system.
Internet Research - Internet Research was used by the researchers to make 
the study feasible. The researchers used the computer to browse the internet. 
They gathered information to be used in the proposed system. Some items 
needed for the system has also been found in the internet. The internet had 
been a great help for searching the process for the building and creating of 
codes.
Library Research - The library served was used by the researchers to make 
the study feasible. The researchers used libraries within the University. 
Unpublished materials, written documents and journals that can be found in 
library were used by the researchers to gather related studies and literatures. 
They gathered information used to conduct in this study. Consultant - With the assistance of consultation the researchers learned and 
gained more ideas about the proposed study in how it would work as well as 
the components and devices that would be needed and used in building-up 
the study and capable to recognize whether the project was feasible or not.
Questionnaire - This was the given to the respondents of the study in order to 
satisfy the researchers goal to get and measure the opinions, polls and 
expectation of the respondents towards the study. The researchers used TAM 
(Technology Acceptance Model) to determine if the technology developed was 
compatible to its softwareto answer the questions based on the following 
criteria: Quality Factors, Perceived of Ease of Use (PEOU), Experience, 
Perceived In Usefulness, Attitude, Behavioral Intention and Actual Use.",Result
"This section discusses the analysis and interpretation of the test result, 
through surveys conducted by the researchers.
The researchers used survey questionnaires for the acceptance of the 
technology using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). These were given to 
the students and faculty members of Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa 
Cruz Campus. This was done to acquire the necessary data to determine the 
efficiency and the effectiveness of the system and ensure that it has fulfilled the 
needs of the client.
To assess the behavioral intention of the users the researchers adapted 
the questionnaire of Khan and Iyer (2009). The researchers use the different 
factors and the acceptability of the students and faculty members. 
The following charts discuss the result acquired from the survey 
conducted with each user assigned for the use of the system. The following 
data were computed, analyzed and interpreted to come up with the result if the 
developed system has satisfied the users. The figure below is the result of the 
evaluation.
