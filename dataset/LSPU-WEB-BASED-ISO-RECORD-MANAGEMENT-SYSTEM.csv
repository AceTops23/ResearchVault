"Information Technology nowadays is changing rapidly, this generation is
extensively grow with technology of information all around us. Everything that 
has seen around is purely a product of high end advancement. This 
advancement of technology provides the importance of information technology 
into a greater value. In a direct result of current economic necessities and 
ongoing technological developments, the IT industry is undergoing a number of 
fundamental shifts.
ISO is the International Organization of Standardization in which it is the 
worldwide federation of national standard bodies. The international standards 
promote the adaption of the process approach when developing, implementing 
and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system. For an 
organization to function effectively it has to identify and manage numerous 
linked activities using resources and managed in order to enable the 
transformation of inputs into output.
Record keeping is one of the most thorough and important requirements 
in the ISO 9001 standard. It is because records must be identified, filed, 
protected and controlled throughout their lifecycle. It is important, because they 
contain the history of how files are functioning. The energy, effort and expense 
of keeping up your quality records are ongoing investments in building a 
reference-base for analysis, compliance and improvement.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) gives the ISO 
9001:2008 or the Quality Management System certification to companies or the 
organizations that can demonstrate ability to consistently provide product that 
meets customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
With the vision to transform lives and communities, Laguna State 
Polytechnic University started efforts to become ISO 9001:2008 certified. This 
big leap of the university started August of last year. Written on the, The Gears 
Publication Newspaper the University President Hon. Nestor M. De Vera, Ph. 
D said during the launching and orientation of Laguna State Polytechnic 
University ISO journey that attaining the certification ensures that international 
standards are given through the services offered by the university. Laguna 
State Polytechnic University aims for ISO 9001:2008 Certification to utilize the 
assurance of quality service to the customer- the student. And it is reflected to 
the Quality Policy of the university’s in which it is committed to continual 
improvement to provide quality, efficient and effective services to the University 
Stakeholder's highest level of satisfaction through a dynamic and excellent 
management system imbued with utmost integrity, professionalism and 
innovation.",Introduction
"Last August 27 last year, the Laguna State Polytechnic University 
personnel were gathered through series of meetings and workshop. This was 
done to determine the foundation of the process and the following steps to be 
accomplished. Engr. Helen Evalle, the university’s ISO consultant, exclaimed 
that is not yet late for LSPU to become ISO 9001:2008 certified. LSPU started 
to meet ISO requirements by the formulation of a Quality Policy were submitted 
until the University President and the Quality Management Representatives 
(QMR) agreed on the final one.The Laguna State Polytechnic University are trying to systemize the 
existing system as according to the international standards. The LSPU ISO 
files, forms and papers are important that needed to be managed every time. 
Some forms are also needed to fill up by some personnel. The Laguna State 
Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus, started efforts to become ISO 
9001:2008 certified. There are 20 offices and departments in which it has forms 
that needed to be manage every time. The researchers aimed to develop an 
“LSPU Web-Based ISO Management System” a web-based system that can 
manage the ISO documentation and forms, manage forms (header, footer, 
revisions) and manage accounts. The system is responsible to record the forms 
that are uniquely identified through a number, code, title, date, storage location 
and other appropriate method. It records are established to provide evidence 
of conformity to requirements and of the effective operation of the quality 
management system shall be controlled. The organization shall establish a 
documented procedure to define the controls needed for the identification, 
storage, protection, retrieval, retention and disposition of records. Records shall 
remain legible, readily identifiable and retrievable. Also forms can easily fill up 
online and can pass it to the respective personnel.
In the improvement of the system, some components are considered 
which the materials to be used. It’s structure, the user interface design and the 
cost to be spent. The researchers have completed identifying these 
components. The first phase of this study is where the researchers developed 
a system that will help the users, which are the ISO personnel, ease their work 
and save 111111their time in viewing and filling up the ISO forms. In this phase, 
the researchers also determined what programming language to use, andcreated a survey which will be used to evaluate the usability, reliability, and 
functionality of the developed system.
After the developers modify the components that is needed, the 
developers proceed to the second phase of the study wherein the developers 
find an answer on how to validate the effectiveness of the developed system 
and some questions that are follows: (1) how effective is the developed system 
in terms of managing and controlling the records of ISO forms? (2) To make an 
evaluation for the developed software to identify the acceptability and behavior 
of the user in using the software (3) will the people who manage the ISO forms 
accomplish tasks more efficiently if the system is uploaded in the internet?",Method
"This includes the important contents such as the information that we've 
gathered. The following instruments or tools were used by the proponents in 
gathering data for the study. The proponents used this as basis for drawing 
conclusions or making assumptions. Some of these instrument or tools are 
interviews, observations, internet research, library research, questionnaires, 
and consultant.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interview to Engr. Raniel Louie W. 
Mendiola the Internal Quality Auditor who also the chairperson on handling the 
ISO forms and Mrs. Jocelyn Francisco the Document Controller Officer who is 
responsible in keeping the records of ISO forms, about the process, problem, 
and desired improvement of their manual system. They also gave us all the 
information that the researchers needs for developing the proposed system. 
Observation
Through observation of the current operating procedure gives the 
researchers additional perspective and better understanding of system 
procedures.
Internet research
The use of the computer and internet helps the researchers in discussing 
the different aspects of the proposed system. It enables the evaluation of the 
hardware and all the materials needed in the study. It provides additional ideas 
in the development of the proposed system. The internet also supplies 
information by providing other proposed study that in which it supports the 
system by means of function and principle. The World Wide Web helps the 
proponents to accomplish the supporting documents for the creation of the 
study. Through internet the researchers search information that will help in 
developing the study. The researchers find some information about ISO 9001 
and visited the Laguna State Polytechnic University website online in which the 
ISO journey of the university is published.
Library research
The library is one of the main sources of information for the researchers 
in gathering information. The researchers visited the Laguna State Polytechnic 
University Santa Cruz Campus Library and other university’s library to read 
previous studies about Record Management System and Web-based system 
to help in terms of related data which are essential in building theories in 
developing the proposed system. The information gathered from the related 
help in building the supporting documents for the proposed system.
Questionnaires
This was given to the respondents of the study in order to satisfy the 
proponent’s goal to get and measure the opinions, polls and attitude of the 
respondents towards the study.
Consultant
According to the assistance of consultant the researchers learned and 
gained more ideas about the proposed study by the help of the adviser and 
system expert. They gave the researchers techniques and ideas in how it 
would work as well as the components and devices that would be needed and 
used in building-up the proposed system and capable to recognize whether 
the project was feasible or not.
 With the help of an adviser, the proponents learn and acquire more ideas 
about the proposed study. The components and devices that are needed are 
also discussed to be able for the proponents to know how each of them works. 
Coding examples for the system are also taken up.
The Thesis Adviser helped the researchers in documentation of the 
proposed system, gave advice on how to document the system in a correct way 
and helped the researchers gather information and gave ideas where to gather 
data and information.",Result
