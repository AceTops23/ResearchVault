"We live in a world that is rapidly evolving through technology. This 
evolution has led to a changing cultural ideology and how we function day to 
day. The influences of technology have become ubiquitous in almost every 
aspect of our current society, including in our educational systems. As 
expectations have risen within our classrooms, both students as well as 
teachers, we are seeing more and more educational technology being 
implemented into academia and at different levels.
Education reform is essential to provide learners with what are 
commonly called 21st century skills. Those competencies includes abilities, 
skills, knowledge, motivations, traits, and values needed to become responsible 
citizens in a learning society and sustain employability throughout life in a 
knowledge economy.
At the administrative level, technology can make education systems 
more efficient by helping teachers and administrators streamline routine tasks 
and improve assessment and data collection. In the classroom, technology can 
be a powerful catalyst for pedagogical change, as students use technology to 
take a more active role in personalizing their own education, and teachers take 
on new roles as facilitators of knowledge rather than knowledge transmitters.
Technology also has the potential to transform education by extending 
the learning space beyond the four walls of a classroom. Although brick and 
mortar schools will continue to play a leading role in education over the coming 
decades, technology offers a variety of learning opportunities beyond the physical limits of school. With the current accelerated growth in mobile devices, 
we are already witnessing the emergence of flexible, open learning 
environments that enable contextual, real-time, interactive and personalized 
learning.
In use for over than a decade, the term “e-Learning” describes a range 
of information technologies at use in schools and corporations for education 
and training. In e-Learning courses, information is presented over computer 
networks to instructors and pupils who are often in different physical locations, 
but all accessing the same materials through their PCs.
",Introduction
"E-learning reduces costs traditionally associated with education (such 
as for classrooms and educational material), to the point that it becomes 
affordable to a developing nation. The first phase of the study aimed to develop 
an e-Learning tool for SMP (Service Management Program) that would elevate 
the way of teaching and the way the students will acquire more knowledge. The 
concept is to have an e-Learning tool that would help the instructors on teaching 
and for the students to be more attentive in learning. A module would be 
uploaded by the instructor for the discussions to be open. The students will get 
modules about a certain topic. After each topic they will have a quiz, after each 
quiz, they will receive the result and a corresponding grade that will be sent to 
them using the system. With the use of fact finding techniques, the researchers
were able to identify the problems and formulate a common objective which is 
to develop and implement the SMP e-Learning System that will help instructors 
and students of College of Computer Studies in providing knowledgeable and 
more efficient education and disseminate more information about their subjects. 
In line with this, research questions were formulated to aid with the 
development of the proposed study: during phase 1 the researchers formulated
the following questions: 1.) How to identify the corresponding software 
application and suitable database for SMP? 2.) What is the suitable interfaces 
to be created in the system?
During the phase 1 of the study the researchers gathered all the 
necessary information to attain and achieved the objectives. Specifically, they 
aimed to: (1) Identified the appropriate programming language/software, the 
researchers use PHP as programming language and SQLyog as database. (2) 
The researchers do some research on what the interfaces to be. The 
researches decided to develop a user-friendly interface that can be used in 
learning SMP.
The study proceeds to its second phase, the researchers developed an
online E-learning regarding SMP. It contains the objective identified from the 
previous phase of the study. how to validate the effectiveness of the developed 
SMP (Service Management Program) E-Learning System, specifically wanted 
to answer the following research questions: (1) How to test the functional 
requirements of the developed system? (2)How to assess the behavioral 
intention of the users in the developed system? (3) How to test and evaluate
the developed system?",Method
"The following instruments were used by the researchers in order to make 
the study feasible.
The researchers used materials such as books, manuscripts, thesis and 
previous related studies to help make the study feasible in providing sufficient 
data needed by the researchers.
Internet Research
The use of the computer and internet helped the researchers in 
discussing the different aspects of the proposed system. It enables the 
evaluation of the hardware and all the materials needed in the study. It provides 
additional ideas in the development of the proposed system. The internet also 
supplies information by providing other proposed study that in which it supports 
the system by means of function and principle. The World Wide Web helped
the researchers to accomplish the supporting documents for the creation of the 
study. 
Interview
The researchers also conducted an interviews with different people to 
know the different problems that they encountered to gather information regarding e-Learning. Their point of view, understanding and opinions that
helped in formulating the understanding on its processes.
Library Research
The library is one of the main sources of information for the researchers 
in gathering information. The researchers read previous studies in the library to 
help in terms of related data which are essential in building theories in 
developing the proposed system. The information gathered from the related
literature and study helped in building the supporting documents for the 
proposed system. The researchers gathered information in the library of 
Laguna State Polytechnic University and Colegio de San Juan de Letran
Calamba.
Consultant
With the help of a consultant, the researchers learned and acquired more 
ideas about the proposed study. The components and devices that are needed 
are also discussed to be able for the researchers to know how each of them 
works.",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test result, 
along with the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discuss if the 
system entitled “SMP (Service Management Program) e-Learning System” has 
fulfilled the needs of its client.
The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the 
survey questioner for the Secretary, Instructors and students of the College of 
Computer Studies. This was done to acquire the necessary data to determine 
the usefulness and the effectiveness of the system.
There are the different types of questions that were given to each 
category of the users. The researchers used a five-point Likert scale on the 
survey questionnaires.
