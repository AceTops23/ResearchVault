"As modern technology steps forward, the amount on information is said to be 
expanding that indicates to formulate new ways of thinking, working and living. 
Technology helps us in all aspects of our everyday life and the most useful to our work 
that offers a better way of living. Computer is one of the products of modern technology 
which helps human in processing the information for such different purposes. It also 
offers fast searching and retrieval of information needed and a better working 
environment in the office. 
A computer is really a remarkable machine that allows people to do many 
different tasks in a convenient way. It provides information and a way of communication 
for every individual. It also gives a better understanding for some event that may take 
place the interest to some particular subject. Universities like Laguna State Polytechnic 
University (LSPU) – College of Computer Studies (CCS) still uses manual processing of 
payment for some college events. Since the CCS handles large number of transactions 
per semester, some problems arises which cause delays to some extent. 
LSPU CCS Payment Transaction Management System proved that computer 
can be very useful to solve a problem that arises from the increasing population of the 
students every year. This system is an offline application that will help the Dean’s office 
of the CCS in making their to tasks faster so that there will be no checking of transaction 
manually, they just need to type the names that are needed to finish a transaction, they 
don’t have to manually write the needed information. The system also offer faster 
transaction in payment and provides accurate reports, it minimized the time and effort 
exerted by both students and the faculty. This study was very beneficial for the CCS 
because the system minimized the effort of the college’s secretary in computation of 
transactions and the paper works done to compile their everyday reports. It also 
convenient to both students and CCS faculty.
",Introduction
"The College of Computer Studies of Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. 
Cruz Campus is still dealing with the manual processing of transaction around the 
college. First, when the student pays for his/her balance, the secretary provides a paper 
which indicates what activity/project is it for. The student fills up the paper indicating his 
name, date, amount and signature, and after receiving payments from students, the
secretary provides a receipt, one copy for the student and one copy for the college.
After the transaction, the receipt was stored in a cabinet as well as the paper 
indicating the information of the transaction on where there is big possibility for the paper 
to misplace.
The slow processing of the payments is the main problem that is facing by the 
department of College of Computer Study. Some of the specific problems are (1) 
Looking for the payment information is time and effort consuming because they need to 
look for the information in the cabinet, (2) Hard to locate those students who is not yet 
paid or having a pending balances and (3) The way they store the information is not 
safe.
That’s why the developers aimed to design and develop a system entitled “LSPU 
CCS Payment Transaction Management System” which would provide a solution for the 
problems that the college encountered. The system would provide an electronic storage 
of information wherein the admin can easily search for the information he/she needed.
The system would also provide an electronic producing of receipt and it could also 
provide a report for those student who still have remaining balance, fully paid and those 
who did not pay so the admin could monitor the system with fast and reliable 
informationPopulation of the Study
The respondents of this study came from LSPU SCC-CCS where the LSPU CCS 
Payment Transaction Management System would be use. The respondents evaluated
and assessed the proposed system by answering the questionnaires.",Method
"Different fact finding techniques were used by the researchers in able to collect 
data from the LSPU - CCS that would be used in creating and designing of system.
The researchers observed the setting and scenario in LSPU - CCS to perceive 
the problems encountered by the secretary in record keeping and data retrieving.
The researchers conducted an interview at the university to gather the data 
needed. The researchers asked some questions to the secretary of the LSPU - CCS to 
get the data in able to build the proposed system. The researchers also collected data 
through internet and library searching. For sampling technique the researchers used 
“Total Enumeration Technique”.",Result
