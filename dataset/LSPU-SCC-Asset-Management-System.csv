"Technology is one of the most important advancement, and a necessity in bringing about progress as we move along in this computerized world. In many ways, the history of computers in business goes hand in-hand with the advent of the industrial revolution and the subsequent advances in science and technology. The use of modern technology today can help the work of man easier and reliable.
             Asset management refers to any system that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or group. It may apply to both tangible assets such as buildings and to intangible concepts such as intellectual property and goodwill. According to Niekerk (2006), Asset management is a systematic process of deploying, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets cost-effectively. The advantages of the technology includes the development of the current system of managing the asset that is effective in keeping records of the asset and the retrieval of information.
The increasing number of records and data are very frightening for the low quality of asset management. The process of asset management used in writing and cabinet storage of papers are too old and worn out in our society today. However, the advancement of technology today offers an achievable work of people easier.
The evolution of asset management are universal in the present day. Considering the benefit of technology and research input, the development of asset management increase for the benefit of community. Effective record management and work efficiency are very essential to attain the ideal asset management.
Most of institute in our society today go all out with the improvement of advance asset management. It provides a fastest way of record management and data transaction. The fact that there are some establishment cannot strive with this changes, still provides them a difficult way of asset management. As supported in this study, the utilization of information technology is one of the appropriate result to derive with efficient asset management along with the support of advance technology define a system develop the current process. 
",Introduction
"The Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU-SCC) was founded in year 1952 out of ideas and dreams that will create and provide high quality education that is responsive to the national goals of youth. It is constructed with different colleges and offices inside its school premises. One of the indoors departments in the university is the Supply Office and its duty is to provide and handle the necessary item or equipment for particular colleges and offices inside the campus.
One way of using technology today is responding the needs and lessens the works of people for their convenient. An effective asset management is a significant system to present a positive assessment of records. In able to develop the outcome of asset management, the researchers formulate the conclusions to obtain the efficiency of the asset management. The researchers’ review the record management of the office 


and it was found out the absence of performance and providing hard time in record monitoring.
The first phase of the study aimed to provide the Office of Supply a support asset management focusing on item consolidation and work efficiency. Specifically the study addressed the following objective: (a) to identify the functional requirements of the asset management (b) to recognize the non-functional requirements of the asset management (c) to determine the appropriate development tool for the study. After the researchers accomplished and completed the objectives, it has been found out that the asset management needs the following: (a) design and develop a functional requirements using web system (b) design and develop the web system to recognize the non-functional requirements (c) use the PHP Language as the development tool to support the design and development of the web system. After determining the formulation of the requirements in utilizing a web system, the researchers considered the effectiveness of the web system if it is uploaded online to provide significance for the transaction of the asset management.
The second phase of the study entitled “LSPU SCC AMS” which sought to find answer the general research questions which confirm the validity of the developed Asset Management System. Specifically to answer the following questions; (a) how to test the functionality of the software by the users, using black box testing? (b) how to assess the acceptability and the behavioral intention of the users in utilizing the develop asset management system? (c) how to develop an implementation plan for the proposal and approval from the office of the president for the full deployment of the asset management system in LSPU main campus?
",Method
"Data Collection Method
The  researchers  used a  deeper  analysis  on   the  problems  that  they  examined  during  the  research,  design  and  data  gathering  process, to be able to gather information needed in the study.
           The researchers used various methods to collect primary and secondary data. For gathering primary data, the researchers done interviews with the people who have access when it comes to the record transaction for the supply office. The researchers also conducted an observation to perceive the assessment of the users with the offices present process. This way, the researchers will have an understanding on where the problem is and what results they should come up with. For the secondary data, the researchers did a precise related literature and internet research which contributes an average of preceding studies that will help them with their study. These are enough predictable sources of knowledge which are helpful for their research. Another method or tool used is online research by the researchers to gather ideas for 



the developed system. The methods mentioned above are ways to obtain secondary data.
To gather primary data or data gained from a primary variable, the researchers will conduct informal interviews and surveys from the variables given.
",Result
"The results and discussion presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results acquired from the conducted techniques by the researchers. It also discusses if the study entitled “LSPU SCC Asset Management System for the Campus of Laguna State Polytechnic University” has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its user.
The researchers formulated the survey questionnaires adapted from TAM which has the quality products to take advantage for the system testing and evaluation. . The researchers used a five-point Likert scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Disagree and Strongly Disagree) on the survey questionnaires.
