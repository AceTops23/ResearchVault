"Some people, especially the elder ones believed that technology is not really necessary. However, technology affects the society really fast. It also becomes a big contribution in bringing so many benefits in people’s life. Technology improves lots of things like efficiency in education, medicine, transportation, entertainment and more. It lessens work and saves time. When it comes to technology everyone thinks of its positive benefits. Technologies improved our daily lives by bringing conveniences. As of this current generation almost everyone is using computerized and automated systems. On the other hand, some people still use the manual operation/process. Through logbook, record books, and etc. and store it on room or cabinet. 
 Apparently, the BMPS is currently using the traditional manual system of crime mapping. In which Google maps are used but what the police officers do is crop it by section in order to have images of the maps where a certain crime has occurred which is very unreliable and even the client that is interviewed told the researchers that it is sometimes inaccurate and takes too much time. In addition, it can also affect the outcome of the records if there are lots of inaccurate information. As of now people lives in modernized community that is why the proponents thought having a system for the clients, for faster and easier work.
 Municipal police are law enforcement agencies that are under the control of local government. This includes the municipal government, where it is the smallest administrative subdivision. They receive funding from the city budget, and may have fewer legal powers than the ""state paid"" police. These police force usually report to a mayor or a local police board. Bay Municipal Police Station is one of those who belong to the community that keeps record on a room. That results to loss of records and misplaced important papers.
  The Bay Municipal Police Station is still using manual operation in mapping the Crime and Incident at BMPS (Bay, Municipal Police Station). In order to solve/avoid these incidents the researchers suggested creating or developing a Crime and Incident Mapping of Bay, Municipal Police Station. Through this, the proponents believed that it can help the client to have an easier, faster, and accurate way of retrieval and recording the Crime and Incident through mapping also by the use of this technology the researchers will provide the client a faster outcomes of the records presented through maps, this way it is easier to see the reports of which crimes that are classified by nature are most committed  and what time it usually occurs that way the client knows the crime clock that is needed in order to perform intervention on the said community, not just by using images of areas at Bay and manually creating maps
",Introduction
"Bay, Laguna belongs to a 2nd Class Municipality. According to the latest census conducted, it has a population of 56,220 inhabitants, has a total land area of 42.7sq.km (NSO Base), composed of fifteen (15) barangays, and a total of forty-one (41) PNP personnel are assigned in the municipality. The BMPS (Bay, Municipal Police Station) contains ten (10) different sections which offer different services to the community these are: Patrol / Traffic, Operation, Investigation, PCR (Police Community Relation), Custodial, WCPD, Intel Admin, Administrative, Non-uniformed Personnel, and Intelligence Section. The Researchers of the study only focuses on the Investigation Section which covers the study that the researchers will be researching which is the Crime and Incident Mapping. The officers assigned at investigation gathers information of different incidents that happens daily in the area of the municipality then creates a Crime Mapping in order to pass to the Provincial, then Regional, and lastly National Office which is the PNP (Philippine National Police). Pile of records of the said crimes and incidents gathered and processed by the investigation section are only stored at the cabinets on the Police Station. That results to a time-consuming work by looking for the old records searching and retrieval of old records slows the process because the investigators still need to look through every record manually. Also, during the Interview with PSSg Reden Cadsawan. It is mentioned that it takes time for the reports to be passed to the PNP because the Police Station lacks a secured way of passing the reports online directly to the PNP office, so what the BMPS do is that reports are passed manually where one person needs to go to the office directly. It is mentioned that the Police Station currently uses manual way of mapping different households and Incidents at Bay by using the Google. ",Method
"Population of the Study                                                                                      
A research is conducted on the Police officers that are members of Bay, Municipal Police Station. It is composed of Chief of Police, Deputy Officer, Custodial Officer, Police Community Relation, Investigation Section, and Police Officer.
Data Collection Instruments
The fact-finding techniques that the proponents used during the data gathering are the following:
Interview 
The Researchers went to Bay, Municipal Police Station to conduct interview last February 4, February 6, February 12, 2020 on the client regarding the processes done for Crime and Incident. PSSg. Reden Cadsawan the Sergeant of Investigation Section explained that currently, Google map online is used for mapping. This becomes a problem because of inaccurate outputs given. It also takes longer time in retrieving old records because of filed documents of crime mapping records.
Peters, Halcomb (2015) “Interviews in qualitative research” mentioned in the study that Interview is a common method of data collection. It is frequently used alone in a qualitative study or combined with other data collection methods in mixed or multi-method research. 
In addition, it is stated by Adhabi, Anozie (2017).  In carrying out qualitative studies, the important issue is the quality of data collected, which is dependent on the mode of data collection used. The interview is one of the data collection techniques for qualitative researchers. Distinct from other methods, interviews have unique features that make them superior. As such, the current study explores relevant issues that are linked to interviews, especially aspects that make them central to qualitative data collection. Besides the historical appeal, the discussion covers the advantages a researcher experiences while using interviews to collect data.
It is also explained that Interview will be helpful because through this the researchers will know through discussion about the practical issues related in conducting the research.
Library Research 
The Researchers conduct different studies on different libraries.   Sometimes when the proponents have vacant time it is spent in looking for different studies at the Research Lab which can be connected in the current study like lots of related studies and literature. References like manual books and internet sources had been useful by the researchers in doing the data gathering.
Atique (2019) “Evaluation of Users Satisfaction with Library Resources and Services” The academic library has proved to be an important part of an educational institution, which helps students in expanding their horizon of knowledge. Being a service Centre within an educational institution it is necessary to satisfy each and every library user by providing quality services. Quality improvement is a continue process, and library staff needs to evaluate library services regularly in terms of user’s satisfaction.
