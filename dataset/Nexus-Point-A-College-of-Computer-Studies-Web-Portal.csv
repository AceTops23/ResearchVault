"Technology is the collection of techniques, skills,
methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the 
accomplishment of objectives or in finding solutions to a problem . Technology 
can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be 
embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of 
their workings.
Universities that prioritize good user experience leverage utilize 
technology through websites to contribute to larger institutional goals and see 
a clear return on investment. Usually, each information source gets its 
dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the 
user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include mash ups and intranet dashboards for executives and managers. The extent to 
which content is displayed in a uniform way may depend on the intended user 
and the intended purpose, as well as the diversity of the content. Very often 
design emphasis is on a certain ""metaphor"" for configuring and customizing 
the presentation of the content and the chosen implementation framework 
and/or code libraries. In addition, the role of the user in an organization may 
determine which content can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal 
configuration.
Web portals have risen in popularity as a way of collecting, organizing 
and presenting content in a highly uniform, customizable and personalized 
way. As the technology that enables the creation and management of these 
web portals have evolved, it is not only information content that is being 
offered, but application functionality as well.
With these concepts the proponent were able to come up with a 
system that incorporates analytics, file distribution, back-end to front-end 
content management and faculty evaluation which is the Nexus Point: A 
College of Computer Studies Web Portal. The portal would be handling the 
count of the registered users in the portal, allows students to evaluate faculty 
members online, allows students to download uploaded files by the faculty to 
serve as a reference in their subjects and to manage content from the 
administrator’s dashboard.
",Introduction
"A portal is a system that serves as a centralized place for accessing 
different resources in the Web (Atlantic Webfitters, 2014). It gathers 
information from different sources and put it all together in a single place 
which can help in accessing information by several users. It provides the 
users with a single point of content, data, and services. It can be personalized 
depending on the role of the user in the organization (Eldrandaly, 2009). 
There are different types of portal: general, community, horizontal, vertical,
enterprise, personal, and niche. Community Portal is a system where the 
users are of same group of interests (Tatnall, 2005). Nexus Point: A College 
of Computer Studies Web Portal, as the proposed gateway shall be labeled, 
s designed and developed for effective information dissemination and class 
management. It eases to lift the burden of students to commute to the 
institution in order to acquire the needed information. Faculty members can 
upload files such as documents and references online and manage their class 
Based on the observations conducted by the researchers, the medium of 
information dissemination and acquiring learning resources are still manual. 
When it comes to announcements, the College of Computer Studies uses the 
bulletin board which students pass by it without bothering to read the 
announcements on the bulletin board. Nexus Point: A College of Computer 
Studies Web Portal is a website that contains a newsfeed for the news, 
events and announcements for both students and faculty of the department. 
Another feature of the proposed project is the content management feature 
wherein the administrator can add and edit content to the front-end by using 
the administrator’s dashboard in the Content Management Tab. Students can 
also post a thread for consultation to answer their questions regarding to 
projects and different requirements in their subjects to know where the 
formats are or where to download the formats of the requirements. The first 
phase of the study entitled “Nexus Point: A College of Computer Studies Web 
Portal” aims to develop a software that would be great help to the students 
and teacher. Specifically aim to answer the following questions. (1) How to
develop a module for college of computer studies that will keep faculty 
members, students or the other users to become updated and socially 
educated? The researchers come up with the idea to make a Nexus Point: A 
College of Computer Studies Web Portal for the College of Computer Studies. 
",Method
"Data Collection Methods
In Data Collection method the researcher is going to use the 2 primary 
methods or most used method in data collecting procedure. The first one is 
observation; Observation entails the systematic noting and recording of 
events, behaviors and artifacts (objects) in the social setting chosen for study. 
The observational record is frequently referred to as field notes – detailed, 
non-judgmental, concrete descriptions of what has been observed. For 
studies relying exclusively on observation, the researcher makes no special 
effort to have a particular role in the setting; to be tolerated as an unobtrusive 
observer is enough. Classroom studies are one example of observation, often 
found in education, in which the researcher documents and describes actions 
and interactions that are complex: what they mean can only be inferred 
without other sources of information. This method assumes that behavior is 
purposeful and expressive of deeper values and beliefs.
Observation can range from a highly structured, detailed notation of 
behavior structured by checklists to a more holistic description of events and 
behavior. The second one is interview; researchers rely quite extensively on 
in-depth interviewing. Kahn and Cannell (1957) describe interviewing as “a 
conversation with a purpose”. It may be the overall strategy or only one of 
several methods employed. To distinguish the qualitative interview from, for 
example, a journalist’s or a television talk-show interview, we might speak of 
its width instead of its depth (Wengraf, 2001). Interviewing varies in terms of a 
priori structure and in the latitude of the interviewee has in responding to 
questions (Patton, 2002) puts interviews into three general categories: the 
informal, conversational interview; the general interview guide approach; and 
the standardized, open-ended interview.Library Research
The library is another place where heaps of previous studies from 
former researchers are stacked. The library makes such information available 
and ready. The studies stored in the library can provide all the necessary 
guides that the researchers will need throughout the study for the research 
and the development of the system. The library also has countless books that 
the researchers will have access to unlike the internet where such books will 
be hard to find.
Internet Research
The internet is a vast and limitless collection of knowledge from various 
people who have expertise in specific fields. Millions of studies, thesis, 
researches and articles are always available on the internet. Though the 
internet cannot always be counted on the consistency of data and said data 
can be wrong at times, the researchers deem the internet is one of the best 
places to collect data needed for the study.
Questionnaires
The fact-finding technique was used by the researchers to collect data 
and other information through questionnaire and feedbacks. The hardware as 
well as software that are involved in the study was tested and evaluated by 
the students and the faculty of the College of Computer Studies.
Expert Consultant
The knowledge of the people who have expertise in fields that the 
researchers will undertake can greatly help in gathering raw data. The 
opinions and constructive criticism of people will undoubtedly assist the 
researchers. One of the best ways to further improve anything is to make sure 
to ask for advice or help from people who know more than him.
Observation
Observation is a useful fact-finding technique that the researcher can 
employ in undertaking the research. Observation requires the researcher to 
see the different problems of the current method and provide a solution to fix 
or improve the current method for the benefit of those people who are using 
the current method.
",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test result, 
along with the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discuss if the 
proposed system entitled “Nexus Point: A College of Computer Studies Web 
Portal” has fulfilled the needs of its client.
