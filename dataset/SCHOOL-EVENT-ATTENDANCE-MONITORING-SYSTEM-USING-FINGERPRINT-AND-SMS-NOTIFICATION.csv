"n today’s generation‚ technology has the big use in our environment. It 
helps especially when education is being talked about. Through technology,
quality of education becomes more effective in learning.
One amazing device that is popular nowadays is the biometrics. A 
person can be identified by multiple of different metrics including their fingerprint 
which can be used to identify or authenticate a person to a certain system. This 
device is mostly used in elections but now this has the big contributions in our 
community. It helps especially in education or campus as their everyday report. 
One good thing that a biometrics can help in the school system is through the
attendance monitoring. We all know that attendance monitoring in school is 
really a hard time for the teacher and students. It consumes a lot of time for 
both of them to fall in line and to look if who among the students are always 
absent. Through also the use of fingerprint in attendance monitoring the student 
will be avoided to cheat. Cheating in a way that‚ when they are logging in 
manually in a record book there are cases that they’ll going to write the name 
of their classmate in the log book even if their classmate is not around. 
Through this reason, it is good to develop an electronic attendance 
monitoring system for the students which will make the process of logging in be 
faster. With just tapping their finger in the scanner‚ it will automatically recognize 
who that student is. Then after recognizing the student or the teacher‚ it will 
record automatically records the attendance then save to the database. The 
database will then be the big help for the teachers because they will never have 
a hard time to know who among their students are absent. Lastly ‚ with the help 
of this kind of attendance monitoring‚ it will lessen the things that is being use 
when monitoring an attendance of a student. For example‚ through using a 
manually record of students’ attendance‚ they still need to buy record book and 
a lot more just to have a log book for students.
",Introduction
"Producing a system that has an innovation in a world of technology is 
really an advantage. It needs a lot of focus and knowledge to produce an 
innovative one‚ especially for an educational purpose. Therefore the 
researchers designed and developed a system entitled “School Event 
Attendance Monitoring using Fingerprint and SMS Notification (SEAMS)” for 
LSPU-SCC that will be used by the students when there are events or activities 
held on their school. Specifically‚ it aims to (1) determine the appropriate 
programming language and data base management system. (2) Identify the 
different college administrator and their specific function in the school event 
attendance monitoring system.
On the second phase of the study‚ the researchers sought to answer the 
following research questions: (1) how to test the developed attendance 
monitoring system on the working environment of Laguna State Polytechnic 
University Sta. Cruz campus? (2) how to develop an evaluation tool that can be 
used in measuring the acceptance of the system as perceived by the target 
respondents? (3) how to create a testing plan that can be applied in the testing 
of the system? (4) how to identify and analyze the cost of the resources that 
were consumed on the development of the system?
",Method
"Data collection Method
All of the techniques that the researchers used in conducting the 
research study were presented below. From the time the researchers started 
conducting their research. Until they analyze the possible difficulties that may 
encounter during the research with the help of the following techniques.
Library research
The researchers used published and unpublished materials like books, 
magazines, thesis and other related materials in researching about the 
developed system. Through this, the researchers used some idea about the 
background and the possible available improvement that the developed system 
could undergo.
Internet research
Another method that the researchers used was through the internet. The 
researchers also used this kind of method to gather information or ideas that is 
needed in the study.
Interview
The researchers also conducted an interview with the respondents to 
know what are the common problems being encountered in using the current 
existing manually operated School Event Attendance Monitoring System.
Observation 
The observation of the current operating procedure gave the 
researchers additional perspective and better understanding of the system 
procedures.
Questionnaire
Questionnaires were given to the respondents of the study in order to 
satisfy the researcher’s goal to get measure the opinions, polls, and attitude of 
the respondents towards the study.
",Result
"The chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if the 
study entitled School Event Attendance Monitoring System using Fingerprint 
and SMS Notification has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client.",Discussion
