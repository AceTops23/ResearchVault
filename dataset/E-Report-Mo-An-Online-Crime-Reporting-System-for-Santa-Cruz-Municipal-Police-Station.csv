"Over the years, technology has revolutionized our world and daily lives. 
Technology has created amazing tools and resources, putting useful information at our 
fingertips. Modern technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices a touch 
just like the smart watch and thus the smartphone. Computers are increasingly faster, 
more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. With all of those revolutions, 
technology has also made our lives faster, easier, better and more fun.
With the arrival of recent technologies, criminal justice professionals have 
started making use of those technologies in legal offices, laboratories, and 
courtrooms. This has enabled today’s forensic investigators, law enforcement 
officials, researchers, judges, and lawyers to stay a step sooner than the criminals. 
Therefore, all aspiring, likewise as current legal professionals must stay up to date 
with the technological innovations happening in their field.
The war against crime and criminality is a global war which is even getting 
more sophisticated with the use of various kinds of hi-tech weapons and devices. As 
the criminals are getting more technical, the agencies responsible for the prevention 
and control of crimes are getting more sophisticated in both their approach and 
equipment. It is also true that the more populated and complex a society becomes, the 
wider the range of antisocial conducts and activities that must be monitored and 
controlled. Crime is part of human activities that must be managed as no human 
society has ever been totally free of criminals and it is unlikely that society will ever 
be.
The advent of technology has opened new fronts of opportunities of leveraging 
on the diverse benefits of information technology to crime reporting. There are 
various technology platforms that have been developed to assist how crime incidents 
are reported, responded to and investigated. The technological applications have gone 
from telegraph, special radio communication, and dedicated phone lines to more 
responsive and more pervasive technological application platforms (web and mobile 
software applications). Majority of the members of society today have mobile devices 
that can easily access the internet. This makes the web approach the most economical 
and open approach for reporting crime with far reaching benefits and coverage.
At police stations all over the world, crime reporting systems are used. It clearly 
looks for guidance and prevention of crime, Criminal prosecution relies on the highly 
responsive backbone of the management records. Police performance and the efficacy 
of tackling crime depend on the quality of information it receives from and has access 
to its current record.
According to the Santa Cruz Municipal Police Station, the issue is that they use 
the manual process of delivery and pick-up of letters from the blue box weekly or 
every Thursday located inside the mall. What if there are very important concerns or 
complaints and probably need an urgent action, it takes a week to make an action on 
the said complaints. Aside from that they use social media pages like Facebook for 
other concerns and suggestions regarding crime reporting. They don’t have a database 
of the files in the computer that takes a long time to find those files when they need it. 
And also the problem is manual viewing of papers, sorting one by one and then 
manual storing of files into the computer. They are having a hard time viewing 
concerns, including comments, complaints and suggestions papers due to having 
disorganized papers. They are having difficulties especially in sorting files one by one in their storing box or computer. The developed online web-based system was 
designed to solve the identified problems encountered by police stations and citizens 
in Santa Cruz Laguna, and was tested and evaluated for its acceptability.",Introduction
"The Philippine National Police (PNP) continue to bolster its trust on active 
community oriented policing as it believes that peace and order is a shared 
responsibility of the police community. In order to maintain peace and security, 
streaming a strong relationship is the key factor for the community relies upon the 
police to serve and protect, and likewise the police relies on the community for its 
support and cooperation in order to effectively out its mandate.
Police Community Affairs Development Branch (PCADB), as The Police 
Community Affairs Development Branch (PCADB) is under a reorganized 
Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). DILG is an executive

CALABARZON Police Regional Office (PRO-4A) has come up with a way to 
allow citizens to express anonymously their complaints, reactions, suggestions, and 
even praises to authorities. Police Regional Office Calabarzon (PRO-Calabarzon) 
kicks off its newest program “Project Blue Box.” A dropbox oriented system that will 
allow the public to report crime and all their concerns and suggestions. In Santa Cruz, 
Laguna has one Blue-Box located at Sunstar Mall by the leadership of Police 
Community Affairs Development Branch (PCADB) of Sta. Cruz, Laguna and Santa 
Cruz Municipal Police Station.
The Santa Cruz Municipal Police Station has some method of reaching people 
but not in the crime reporting. Their resources in crime reporting are paper based 
processes for the complainant who has connections with the institute. This is one gap 
for them since they are unable to help people in accessing their duties in responding 
from their complainant and complaints. Regarding this problem, the researchers
developed an online crime reporting system that can be used by the people (a) Focus 
on helping in crime reporting between the SMPS and the citizens of Sta. Cruz, Laguna (b) The system designed to easily monitor the crime reporting process of the citizens 
in the Santa Cruz, Laguna; and (c) The system developed to generate reports, storing 
and updates of information of all crimes, complaints and suggestions.",Method
"Population of the Study
The population is very essential in research study because it is an aggregate or 
totality of all objects, subjects or members that conform to a set of specifications and 
states the people who will be using the developed system.
The total population of Santa Cruz Province of Laguna is 133,150 in the year of 
2020. The respondents of the study would be coming from the 26 barangay in the 
Municipality of Santa Cruz. The researcher gathered information from their client to 
find out the crime reported for the last two years to find out which barangays have the 
highest and lowest crime recorded for the last two years. And this will be the basis for 
selecting prospective respondents for the selected citizens of Santa Cruz. The 
respondents were asked to give and describe their expectations and feedback 
regarding the development of the system.Data Collection Instruments
To be able to gather data and information easily and effectively, the researchers 
chose to perform the following data collection methodsInterview. The researchers have conducted a personal interview with Police 
Officer CAD Admin. The Interview includes probing questions which involve a 
series of follow-up questions to learn more about the client involving the 
processes and ways on how they provide their services. This method helps the 
researchers to learn about their present problems, giving an idea to specify the 
needed function of the study.
Observation. The researchers made an actual observation to the nature of work of 
the law enforcement in the Santa Cruz Municipal Police Station (SMPS) to 
determine the processes involved in the crime reporting. As the proponents 
conducted their preliminary interviews and further consultations, the researchers 
were able to observe the processes and techniques used by the office staff to 
provide the services. Through observation the researchers become exposed to the 
client’s work environment, thus helping the researchers learn how the office staffs 
work together to execute their services.
Consultation. This method helped to plan the scope and limitations for the study. 
The proponents acquired ideas that were broken down in order to understand what 
can be done considering the time allotted for the system to be created and 
working. With the help of the proponents’ adviser, providing features on the 
website came to a conclusion.
Online Research. With the use of the internet, the researchers gather ideas, 
concepts, and information about the related studies. The researchers vigorously 
browse the wide range of information to get a certain fact. Since the internet has a 
vast amount of information about a certain topic, the researchers intensively 
choose and filter the information through verification and comparison with other 
related information to extract the needed information that applies to the researchers’ study. Through videos, articles, and other informative sites, the 
researchers form an idea on how the study will be done
Library Research. The open library in LSPU Santa Cruz Campus helps the 
researchers gather data in an easy and affordable way. It has a lot of information 
especially information which is related to the proponents’ study. The previous 
research works by past graduates gained a lot of influence for the structure of the 
researchers’ study. This includes the processes and techniques on how they 
develop their studies. The ways and techniques of conducting their study gives an 
idea on how the researchers will apply what they have done before and improve it 
to provide innovation for the sake of technological development.",Result
"This chapter contains detailed presentation and discussion of data analysis and 
the results based on the objectives of the study. The proponents discussed the “E REPORT MO: An Online Crime Reporting System For Santa Cruz Municipal Police 
Station” with the purpose to improve according to the user’s needs.",Discussion
