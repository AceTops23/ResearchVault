"The impact of technology in modern life is not measurable with the 
passage of time, we live in a world that is rapidly evolving through technology. 
The evolution has led to a changing ideology and how we function in our 
everyday lives. According to Sarah Schmitt (2011), students reading and writing 
skills have suffered significantly and their vocabularies are shrinking. It was also 
integrated the negative effects of technology because it is one of the hindrances 
that affect students to divert their attention and forget more important things. The 
students should know how to balance technology and education because this 
new mentality of technological implementation has begun to affect the field of 
education. The newest technologies allow us to forget education and enjoy the 
millennial changes. The technology affects the environment and society and the 
demands of the technology keep on rising since it can be used in every way 
especially in education. We should use technology to improve the learning 
materials used in schools. 
Interactive Learning Aid is something intended to enhance the concept of 
learning by having new skills and techniques that will engage students to learn 
new lessons. Learning Aid should be interactive in every aspect because it is 
important to attract the learners by giving them something that can get their 
attention. It’s a millennial world and students will be more enthusiastic to browse 
lessons through technologies such as computers. Merging technology and 
education can be a great tool for teachers to gain the attention of their students 
by using technology as an instrument in their every lecture. Interactive Learning 
Aid is a real-world approach to education it can actively engages the students to 
focus on their studies. Teaching with technology can deepen the student learning 
yet it can be challenging to select the “best” technological tools that they can use 
without losing sight of their goals for student learning. The use of Interactive 
Learning Aid has been seen to have numerous benefits to many and the 
pressure on teachers to implement technology in the classroom have been 
influenced by the society. In addition, the Department of Education is 
encouraging teachers to develop innovative way of teaching to cope with the 
need of the century learners.
Interactive Learning Aid refers to a form of learning in which the gap 
between the teachers and the students are bridged using new technologies. It 
can help the teachers to train the students in using technology in school and 
enhance their skills using computers. Interactive Learning Aid can help the 
teachers to enhance the teaching and learning processes in a way that they can 
encourage the students to study and be attentive in their subject. The use of 
Interactive Learning Aid can have different benefits because it is the best way to 
emerge with the developing technology
Education are constantly changing we do not expect the students to sit at 
a desk and take notes on a lecture, but lessons should be more engaging and 
interactive to gain their attention. As the schools advance and add technology, 
lessons also become more attractive to the students. As we continue to keep up 
with advancing technology, it can provide incredible benefits to both student and 
teachers. The use of technology as a learning aid for the students is a very 
effective way to gain their attention at the same time they can enjoy while they 
are learning.",Introduction
"Don Manuel Rivera Memorial National High School (DMRMNHS) formerly 
called Linga Annex is the first public high school at the town proper of Pila, 
Laguna. It was a dream come true for the newly elected mayor when it was 
opened on June 17, 2002 the first day of classes for the school year 2002-2003. 
The teachers in DMRMNHS are still using the traditional way of teaching their 
students. They are using modules and books in every subject since it was a 
public school the materials are not enough for all the students.
The K to 12 programs is an education system under the Department of 
Education that aims to enhance learners’ basic skills, produce more competent 
citizens, and prepare graduates for lifelong learning and employment so it means 
that the students will add another two (2) years to their high school life. There are 
many students in public school, so the government cannot provide all the 
equipment and modules needed by the student. Sometimes the students lose 
their focus in studying because there are limited materials that they can use. The 
Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE) subject has many scope and the
teachers are not able to give all the materials they need for this subject. The 
millennial generation and they will always be bored with a book that is full of 
lessons and lectures but when it comes to technology they can just forget the 
books and focus on other things. 
The DMRMNHS has limited books and limited materials because there 
are many students. The books and materials are not enough for all the students. 
The teachers in DMRMNHS are still using traditional teaching in their subjects. 
The teacher’s ways of teaching their students will always be challenging and 
hard because they need to check if their students are listening attentively in 
every lesson. Particularly in public schools wherein the teachers have limited 
materials for the students and the schools can’t provide enough modules for 
every student. The technology especially the social media has been the number 
one reason why the students always lose their concentration in studying. The 
students lose the enthusiasm in studying if lessons will be given through needing 
materials through print.",Method
"The researchers used different methods in gathering information before 
developing this system, one of which was the brainstorming wherein the researchers 
discuss their different ideas, suggestions and opinions. The researchers also discuss
about the possible hardware and software that they will need to use to achieve their 
objectives. 
The following instruments were used to make the study feasible:
Observation
The researchers observed the students and teachers in Don Manuel Rivera 
Memorial National High School to gain more information and to find out the problems of 
the existing process in the school. The researchers also gain more knowledge about the 
client while observing.
Questionnaire 
The researchers used questionnaires to identify the impact of the study to the 
students and help the interactive learning aid to the students. 
Interview 
The researchers interviewed one of the teachers in T.L.E subject in Don Manuel 
Rivera Memorial National High School to know the problems in their existing process and 
to provide a solution that the researchers can developed. The researchers used interview 
as the foundation for creating the conclusions and assumptions about the research.
Internet Research 
The researchers used internet to search some related studies and articles and 
become their basis and references for the developed study. The researchers also used 
internet as guide to prove some study. 
Library Research 
The researchers used some old thesis as their reference and additional knowledge for 
their developed study.",Result
"In this section, the researchers show the results of the developed system “TILA: 
TLE Interactive Learning Aid” as stated by the respondents in terms of the Usability, 
Reliability, Efficiency, Maintainability, Functionality and Portability. The data gathered 
from the pre-test and post-test from the respondents were analyzed, tabulated and 
interpreted to determine the difference of student’s performance in pre-test and post-test",Discussion
