"Computer technologies are usually used at the present time in different 
aspects because it helps people a lot in terms of its services. It is very 
convenient and helps us in our job like minimizing our time in doing our works. 
Today, through the help of computers, information can be easily accessed and 
updated. By technological innovation, many organization looks for a change to
enhance the method of managing a monitoring system.
Monitoring means the repeated assessment of ongoing program 
activities to describe what the program was doing. By regularly tracking the 
activities and performance of a program throughout its duration, monitoring can 
explain what services a program is providing. In article by Mikamiand and 
Kuroda (2014) entitled “Monitoring System and Monitoring Program”, they
mentioned that monitoring system performs cause analysis of an event 
occurring in any of a plurality of monitoring-target objects to be monitored based 
on a rule. In the case, the monitoring system makes detection during the 
analysis time width and determines a plurality of conclusions based on an event 
corresponding to the condition for determining the conclusion. Moreover, the 
monitoring systems performs one or more of displaying change of certainly to 
be used for determination of a conclusion in a case where the analysis time 
width was assumed to be changed, performing sort display of the determined 
conclusion based on an index value showing an affected range and calculating 
the analysis time width based on the index value.
",Introduction
"The town of Santa Cruz was a first class urban municipality and capital 
of the province of Laguna in the Philippines. The town is composed of 26 
barangays. Services offered by the government includes a medical assistance 
to provide medicine for every municipality, providing financial assistance to poor
residents and giving financial support to residents who needs money to pay 
hospital bills. The Medical Assistance Office conduct medical mission in each 
town under municipality of the Province of Laguna. The Medical Assistance 
Office uses the traditional way of managing their inventory. Some data were 
often lost and there is no data security, no proper storage of data, data 
redundancy, and no proper monitoring of residents who are given free medicine 
by the government.
The first phase of study entitled “Municipal Medical Assistance Office 
Medication Monitoring System with SMS Notification” aimed to automate the 
medication monitoring system of Medical Assistance Office. It specifically 
aimed to answer the following research question: (1) What are the problems 
that the Medical Assistance Office encountered when they are using the 
traditional way of data monitoring? (2) How to developed a system that will give 
a guide information dissemination? (3) What was the appropriate system that 
can be used to automate the manual way of monitoring the data in Medical 
Assistance Office?
The second phase of the study entitled Municipal Medical Office 
Medication Monitoring System with SMS Notification aimed to answer the 
following research questions: (1) how to test the functionality of Municipal
Medical Office Medication Monitoring System with SMS Notification as 
perceived by the user? (2) how to evaluate the acceptability of the system using 
the Technology Acceptance Model questionnaire? (3) how to develop an 
implementation plan for the Municipal Medical Office Medication Monitoring 
System with SMS Notification?",Method
"Data Collection Methods
The following instrument was used by the researchers in order to make 
the study feasible. The researchers used materials such as books, manuscripts, 
thesis and previous related studies to help make the study. The internet also gave a big contribution in providing sufficient data needed by the 
researchers. 
The researchers provided a survey questionnaire and interview to know 
the problem, process and nature of the Medical Assistance to fix and enhance 
their problem regarding monitoring and inventory process using the created 
system. Below is the list of methods that researchers used:
Interview
The researchers conducted on interview in Medical Assistance Office 
and certain barangay to know the different problem that they 
encountered in monitoring and management of data.
Observation
Based on the observation of the researchers, they found out that the staff 
suffer hard work upon gathering information from the residents regarding 
their needs and distributing the right medicines based on their illness. 
Questionnaire
The researchers used the Technology Advance Model (TAM) 
questionnaire to assess the effectiveness of the system in terms of 
Quality Factors. Whether if the system meets the expectation if the users 
and of the system provided less frequency of software failure. 
Internet Research
The researchers also conducted some internet research to acquire 
related information to understand the studies and to know the techniques 
and sample design for system.
Library Research
Researchers gathered information from different books and magazines 
in order know different approaches on how to manage the health 
monitoring system.
Consultant
The support of a consultant and some IT Experts, was considered by the 
researchers gain more ideas about the created study. The software 
needed and hardware devices that are needed are also discussed to be 
able for the researchers to know how each of them works and how can 
it helpin creating the system to be functional and reliable. After collecting 
relevant information using different data gathering procedures, the 
researchers classified the possible advantages of the different users and 
possible beneficiaries of the system.",Result
"The chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if 
the study entitled Municipal Medical Assistance Office Medication Monitoring 
System with SMS notification has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client.
