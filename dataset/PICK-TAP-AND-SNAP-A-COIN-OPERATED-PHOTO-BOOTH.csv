It also gives the event organizer or the planner one less thing to worry about 
on that particular event.
A photo booth includes an electronic camera for capturing and 
producing a digital image of a customer. It processes the digital image to 
apply a special effect to the image and prints the processed digital image. 
Showing the processed digital image to the customer produces a motion 
image display simulating the sequential production of the processed image 
while the image is being processed and printed. It was patented in 1997 under 
the name of Richard A. Simons; his invention of photo booth has been 
popular and available in the market since then.
In the Philippines, most of the photo booths are for rent. Since Filipinos 
love to take photos they tend to rent a photo booth in almost every event and 
special occasions in their lives. Picture taking was the most fun and exciting 
part of any event, Filipinos enjoy having their picture taken with different kinds 
of accessories or props to go with the theme of the event. One important thing 
about photo booths is that they preserve memories of the event through 
pictures and it serves as a remembrance for all those who came to the event.
",Introduction
"A traditional event photographer captures images of guests throughout 
an event, but a photo booth can add a different style of photography. You can 
get your photo printed out quickly. You can see your photos in just a few 
seconds and bring them home with you. There is no limit with the number of 
photos you can print except if the printer runs out of ink. This allows people to 
have their pictures taken as much as they like. The photos from the photo 
booth also serve as souvenirs for the guests and at the same time, they can
also get their own copy of the pictures as remembrance.
A touch screen is an input device normally layered on the top of an 
electronic visual display of an information processing system. A user can give
an input or control the information processing system through simple or multi touch gestures by touching the display screen. Touch screen monitor enables 
people to use computers without any training because this technology is 
simple and user friendly. Unlike before, photo booth of today also allows users
to customize their own photos.
The researchers decided to develop a coin-operated photo booth that 
can be operated by the user without the help of professional photographer. A 
standalone photo booth that any individual can use and enjoy, by simply 
tapping the touch screen monitor the user can generate their own photo. 
During the phase one of the study the researchers had an idea of 
improving the photo booth rentals that is being used in almost every occasion. 
To gather the information needed, the researchers conducted a survey and 
did some internet research. In order to accomplish the study, the researchers 
listed the following questions: (a) How to identify the appropriate device for 
the development of the system (b) How to develop software that should work 
well with the device? (c) Was the hardware devices needed to support the 
design kiosk are accessible?
Obtaining the questions in phase one, the researchers developed the
“Pick Tap and Snap: A Coin-Operated Photo Booth” a standalone photo booth 
wherein the user can produce their photo by just tapping the screen of the 
kiosk. In order to prove that the developed system was effective it requires 
answering the following questions: (a) What evaluation tool to use in 
evaluating the developed system in terms of effectiveness? (b) How to test 
the functionality of Pick Tap and Snap: A Coin-Operated Photo Booth as 
perceived by the user? (c) How to evaluate the acceptability of the system 
with the use of the evaluation tool?
",Method
"Data Collection Methods
The researchers used the following tools like interviews, observations, 
internet research, library research, and consultant. The researchers used 
these following tools for the collection of data of the study.
Interview 
The researchers conducted an interview in Sta. Cruz, Laguna where 
there are some photo booth rental shops like Sign and Precious Balloons. The 
researchers gathered the data by asking questions to get the needed 
information’s from the interview.
Observation
The researchers obtained additional perspective and better 
understanding of the system process, through observation of the existing 
operational system.
Internet Research
The internet provides the researchers more information about the 
system. It served as a reference on their documentation.
Library Research
The researchers’ related studies were taken from the previous studies 
found in the library in which the researchers found significant with their study. 
The library served as one of the main sources of information for the 
developed study of the researchers.
Consultant
With the assistance of their adviser, the researchers learned and 
gained more knowledge about the study on how it worked as well as the 
components and devices that would be needed and used in building-up the 
system.
Questionnaire
This is given to the respondents of the study in order to satisfy the 
researchers’ goal to get and measure the opinions, polls and attitude of the 
respondents towards the study.
",Result
"This chapter discusses the results of the evaluation of analyzing the 
data, data collection method, sample size and sampling method and the 
number of respondents.",Discussion
