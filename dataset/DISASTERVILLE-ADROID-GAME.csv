"The notion of new innovative technological advances greatly garners the 
attention and interest of many, most especially young people. Technology is very 
much widespread all over the world that it is often used in this digitized 
contemporaneity. It is a tool that is easier to use and manage, and is used to 
exchange information. The development of high technology including computer 
technology, Internet, telephones and mobile devices help conquer 
communication barrier and bridge the gap between people all over the world.
Mobile technology has expanded dramatically around the world. As a matter of 
fact, a Cisco Visual Networking Index stated that globally, smartphones would 
account for 23% (6.2 billion) of all networked devices in 2021, compared to 21% 
(3.6 billion) in 2016. This proves just how vast the extent of mobile technology is. 
Due to its geological structure and location, the Philippines is very likely to 
suffer from natural disasters. In the last decade, the Philippines has been hit 
severely by natural disasters. In 2005 alone, Central Luzon was hit by both a 
drought, which sharply curtailed hydroelectric power, and by a typhoon that 
flooded practically all of low-lying Manila's streets. Still more damaging was the 
1990 earthquake that devastated a wide area in Luzon, including Baguio and 
other northern areas. The city of Cebu and nearby areas were struck by a 
typhoon that killed more than a hundred people, sank vessels, destroyed part of 
the sugar crop, and cut off water and electricity for several days. The Philippines 
sit astride typhoon belt and are usually affected by 15 and struck by five to six 
cyclonic storms per year; landslides; active volcanoes; destructive earthquakes; 
tsunamis.
West (2013) mentioned that governments are increasingly using mobile 
technology in natural disaster preparedness and public safety response. Since 
mobile devices are widely known and used in the Philippines and since 
Philippines is a disaster prone country, the idea of incorporating mobile devices 
onto promoting disaster awareness and preparedness surfaced. ",Introduction
"The Pacific Ring of Fire, as stated by Pecier Decierdo (2018) in a paper, is 
an arc around the Pacific Ocean where there are many active volcanoes and 
where earthquakes frequently happen. It also hosts many dormant volcanoes 
that were very active in the past. The Ring of Fire includes New Zealand, Papua 
New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, and nearly the 
entire west coast of North and South America. It is the site of around 90 percent 
of the world’s earthquakes and is home to 75 percent of the world’s active and 
dormant volcanoes. The Philippines is well within the Ring of Fire. This is can be 
seen in the number of volcanoes in the region as well as the frequency of 
earthquakes in the country.
Disaster awareness and preparedness is a measure taken by people who 
could substantially minimize loss and damages from natural hazards. However, 
the levels of household disaster preparedness are often low even in disaster prone areas, said Hoffman (2017). Children can have a hard time grasping the 
concept of disasters and awareness and even though they are taught explicitly 
about it, they tend to forget what they are taught. Include the fact that when such 
things are taught, the methods used are the traditional way, which can be quite 
bland and easily forgettable for people of young age. Another thing is that when 
children are explicitly told that they need to study and understand something, it 
suddenly turns into a responsibility, which makes them feel burdened.
Since the Philippines is one of the countries that are most vulnerable to 
extreme weather events, Smart created the Batingaw application to enable users 
to get and share information in times of emergencies. It has an offline section 
that contains disaster preparedness information and a phone directory of 
significant government agencies. Those with internet connection can receive 
tweets and reports from government and disaster-related agencies through the 
application.
Local and international businesses, organizations and foundations have 
started to use mobile technology in disaster awareness, preparedness, and 
response. 
Sesame Workshop and Qualcomm launched a mobile safety program that 
relies on mobile technology in China through its Wireless Reach initiative, with a 
focus on preparation. It promotes an Android application and a HTML 5 mobile 
website with a chalkboard that gives kids experience “writing their names and 
addresses, dial[ing] their home phone numbers and draw[ing] pictures of their 
homes or emergency meeting places.” The program incorporates Sesame Street 
content, including videos that help young people learn about emergencies and 
ways they can protect themselves.
“Batingaw” is an app developed by Smart Communications, Cebu-based 
startup Tudlo Innovations Solutions, and the Office of Civil Defense-National 
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (OCD-NDRRMC) in the 
Philippines. The mobile application provides government agencies, 
organizations, and individuals with immediate access to disaster warnings, 
advisories, location data, and disaster mappings. It features step-by-step 
instructions that can guide users to safety during disasters. The application also 
enables users to contribute information to emergency agencies more easily and 
quickly. It does not focus only on preparation but also on safety response. 
According to a blog posted on 2014, Smart Head for Public Affairs Group Ramon 
R. Isberto said, “We support initiatives that utilize the mobile phone as a tool for 
disaster preparedness. These days, almost everyone has a mobile phone, and 
this can be a valuable lifeline during emergencies.”",Method
"The mobile game “Disasterville” is inspired by various games that were 
also about disasters such as “Tanah: The Tsunami and Earthquake fighter”, “Sai 
Fah The Flood Fighter”, and “Kids Fire Patrol”. The game environment however 
was mainly inspired by the game “Sai Fah The Flood Fighter”. 
“Disasterville” has a cartoonish type of visualization to enable the users to 
easily navigate through the game and to enable them to easily understand the 
interface.
The figures shown below exhibit images from the game “Disasterville”. 
From the images provided, the basic controls to be used in the game can be 
noticed. At some portions of the games, there are buttons that the users could 
click in order to get to the next part of the game. To be able to move through the 
game, the users could drag on the lower left side of the screen to go left or right. 
The images also exhibits some tips on the various disasters.",Result

questionnaires together with the respondent’s answers and the evaluation tool 
used in the study.",Discussion
