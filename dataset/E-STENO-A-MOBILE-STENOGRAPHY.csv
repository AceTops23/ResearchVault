"Technology is power. The integration of technology is widely use today 
by everyone. Especially on the education sphere, students mostly depend on 
information technology in doing their home works, quizzes and projects. Internet 
made everyone connected to each other, also in terms of exchanging ideas and 
disseminating information all over the world. The innovation of technology is 
rapidly growing. From the big keypad mobile phones back then, now we have 
touchscreens gadgets which are very interactive and easy to use.
Philippines is one of the fastest-growing market for smartphones in the 
Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) according to a new report from 
market research company International Data Corporation (IDC) in 2016. Filipino 
people are mostly engaged in using mobile phones as a medium in 
communication and in retrieving information. This cause the growth and 
competition of local brand smartphone companies. Price gets cheaper every time 
new technology released. Even common people can affordably buy smartphones 
suit to their needs. Most of schools today use E- learning in giving kids 
knowledge even they’re at home. E-learning transforms the style of teaching in 
school by providing modules online so that student can look at it anytime and 
study in advance. This serves as a solution in the traditional way of teaching 
where students will first hardly find books in the library or in the bookstore, 
copying all notes from the blackboard, passing thick files of project etc. 
Quipper in partnership of Department of Education provides E-learning 
service which already 1 million Filipino students registered. About 1,400 schools 
in 165 divisions of DepEd across the archipelago currently using Quipper. 
According to the article of Campos 2016, for the past two years, the e-learning 
service provider Quipper has been in the forefront of advancing the learning level 
of Filipino students through tools employing information and communications 
technology. It has also helped teachers use instruction methods that inspire 
students to learn even their most disliked subjects. Truly many Filipino’s has 
been effectively attained learning using this platform.
In order to withstand in the growth of the society, technology enthusiasts 
on the present day are resilient in finding solutions to the problem of the people. 
Their eagerness to innovate something made every day of our lives easier and 
faster. A mobile courseware fills up the gap of the old way of teaching. The use 
of mobile devices expands the workplace of people making them to conveniently 
educate and informed anytime and anywhere. A courseware that consist lessons, 
tutorials, quizzes practice educators ahead of time. Reviewing lessons through 
courseware is a good assistance for students who need to take exams. Mobile 
Courseware is a breakthrough to all keen learners.",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the article in court reporter edu.org 2017, stenography is a 
concept of “writing what you hear”, defending on language which represent 
specific sounds, concepts or letters that have specific meaning. Writing in 
shorthand isn’t as easy as writing in alphabet; it has rules that are needed to 
follow. Office Administration students in LSPU encountered difficulty in learning 
stenography. Learners experience tensions while studying shorthand because 
every symbol that they write is needed to be accurate and precise. Also, the 
inability to retain their previous learning in steno and low English vocabulary 
affects the speed of writing in shorthand.
In the realization process of the study it has been found out that there are 
several problems that the proponents need to address and the main problem is 
that learners encounter difficulties on the process of learning stenography.
Specifically this proposed study sought to address the following question: (a) how 
would the proponents determine the appropriate development tools for the 
modules and application to use for designing the system? (b) How can the 
proponents design a Courseware Mobile Application that will help Office 
Administration students effectively? (c) How would the proponents create a 
system that will serve as a guide to all who wants to study stenography?",Method,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Collection Method
The proponents used numerous methods in gathering data such as 
researching in library reading previous thesis and surfing internet, collecting and 
comparing related studies and literature that somehow similar to study. Theproponents conducted an interview to the teacher of Stenography to gather 
information about the problems that the students were encountered while 
studying stenography.
The following instruments were used in order to make the study possible:
Interview
The proponents conducted interviews with the respondents to be able to 
know the common problems being encountered using the traditional learning of 
stenography. The proponents interview the teacher of office administration in 
order to gather information in the manual process and other important 
information dealing the subject stenography. Through this, the proponents 
somehow learned the existing process in learning stenography that can be used 
in the study.
Survey
The proponents performed a pre-assessment survey to the office 
administration students to get the data needed in the proposed study. Their 
answers show that the proposed study is really needed in one of their subject, 
which is stenography.
Internet Research
The proponents also gathered data through internet research. Browsing in 
the internet provided the proponents more explanation about the study and helps 
in understanding some information related to the study. The proponents easily 
found reliable information that can be used in the study.
Library Research
 The proponents visited and went to different schools to conduct study 
and differentiate their study to other study. This is to find some relevant 
information and ideas that can be used in the study.
Sampling Technique
The researchers used stratified random sampling. Stratified 
sampling is a probability sampling technique. The researchers divided the entire 
population into different subgroups or strata, and then randomly selected the final 
subjects proportionally from the different strata.
Questionnaires
This was given to the respondents of the study in order to satisfy the 
proponent’s goal to get and measure the opinions, polls and attitude of the 
respondents towards the study.
Consultation
 According to the assistance of Adviser or Specialization Expert the 
researchers learned and gained more ideas about the proposed study in how it 
would work as well as the facts about stenography that would be help in building up the proposed application and capable to recognize whether the project was 
feasible or not.",Result,,,,,,,,,,,
