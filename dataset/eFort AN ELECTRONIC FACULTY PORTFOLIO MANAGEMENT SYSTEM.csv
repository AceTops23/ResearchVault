"The technology is widely implemented in today's modern world. It continuously spreads and changes every time. And as the technology innovates, many of us rely on it. It affects the works of everyone in everyday lives, making the work easier and faster. Because of that, many things are done better.
  One of the best example of technology is a computer. It is an electronic machine that can store and handle large amounts of information. Communication, entertainment and providing information are examples of how a computer works. Exchanging of information allow people to communicate with one another in the country and outside of it. By simply means of that, it stays the world connected by each other.
 Technology altered the way people do their jobs in companies and even in schools. One of the reason why, is the efficiency of the technology used. Using preferred systems in the computer, an organization helps to manage their files that control limitless of actions depends on how they created it. In school, portfolio of faculties are being implemented. Portfolio is composed of different documents, likes Certificates, Seminars Attended, Resume, Teaching Philosophy, Individual Faculty Development Plan, and are presented together in a folder. Keeping managed documents can easily track a certain file whether it is alphabetically in order, by category or what so ever kind of sort they did.
As described from Walton (2015), in her study “Faculty Information System”, the University's system provides faculty with a secure, Web-based resource for creating annual reviews, online profiles, and other documents important to academic careers. It allows researchers to create an NIH Biographical Sketch and generate a report that can be used during the performance review process. Faculty can also search the system by research interests and/or publication topics to identify faculty with particular expertise and interests.  The Faculty Information System of the University of Pittsburgh requires an account to access the system.
",Introduction
"College of Computer Studies filing of documents are needed time to arrange.  There are twenty-seven (27) instructors in the college. The instructor will submit the needed file to the Dean’s Office. Last semester, A.Y. 2015-2016, the College of Computer Studies Associate Dean implements a portfolio wherein the files and submissions of documents of the instructor are being collected and filed in a folder. Then manual checking of submissions are followed after all files has been collected and it consumes time to have a report. Data Collection Methods
In order to obtain and to gather data that was necessary in this study, the following methods were used by the proponents in order to make the study feasible: 



",Method
"In order to obtain and to gather data that was necessary in this study, the following methods were used by the proponents in order to make the study feasible: 
Observation - the researchers conduct a direct observation to gather the data and information that can help the study.  The gathered information was reviewed to point out what the main problem is.

Library research - from the month of November, the researchers gather information from unpublished material to collect local related studies and to review what programming languages they used to construct the system.

Internet research - internet search is one of the source used by the researcher to support the study using the Google Scholars on World Wide Web to collect foreign and local literatures to support the study.

Consultations - in the assistance of capstone adviser, client, and IT Experts, the proponents learned and gained more ideas about the study. It helps the researchers to know how the system will work that will be needed and used in building up the system and capable to recognize whether the study is feasible or not.

Questionnaire - this was given to the respondents to evaluate if the system provides a desired output that satisfies the respondents according to the five (5) criteria.

",Result
"The assessment of the proposed system involves five (5) criteria. These are the Usability, Functionality, Reliability, Maintainability, and Portability. The ",Discussion
