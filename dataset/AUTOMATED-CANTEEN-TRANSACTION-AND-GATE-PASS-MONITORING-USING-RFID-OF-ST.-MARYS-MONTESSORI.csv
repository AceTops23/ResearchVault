"Computer technology brings significance and advancement in our lives.
From an industrial society, the researchers in transition to an information 
society. The process of deriving in this transition and advancement of man are 
the computer and the people who strive to work for these changes. This 
advancement of computer has been a great factor in our daily living. 
Nowadays, computer is one of the main reasons why almost everything 
becomes so simple and easy from difficult and complicated way of 
accomplishing each job almost everything now is being operated and manage 
through computers. Today it is widely recognized that most organizations 
need information systems to survive and succeed in the competitive business 
environment.
Technology evolved so fast and it’s indescribable how companies, 
business firms, institutions, organization and even schools are influenced by 
it. However, in the recent past there were several incidents at the school or 
university where laptop or gadgets of students were stolen within the school 
or university premises. As a result the authorities introduced a gate pass 
system with the intention of preventing such occurrences.
Payment card acceptance provides real-time transaction authorization 
with an immediate guarantee from the card's issuing bank, effectively 
transferring transactional and credit risk to the issuing bank and away from 
the merchant. Automatic payment authorization via electronic payment also provides an effective control to ensure that shipment of goods is based on 
legitimate, secure, and timely payment.
With the brisk development of e-commerce which means online 
business, and e-payment systems have evolved steadily in order to multiply 
both online as well as offline trade transactions for payment settlement. The 
advents of payment cards have seen a complete traversal from the 
conventional cash payment systems to a more secure online payment 
method.",Introduction
"School is considered as a second home. Students, teachers, 
employees spent most of the time in school. School canteen serves the 
student, staff and teacher such as food, beverages, school supplies etc. In the 
existing system, cash payment is the only option for making the payment. In 
many institutions and organizations particularly school, monitoring of students 
is a very important factor specially in identifying every individual coming in and 
out of the school every day. Crimes increase everyday as the school is one of 
the places where most of the crimes occurred. Security is at risk because in 
many cases outsiders who were not students or enrolled in the school 
bypasses guards and personnel assigned. The St. Mary’s Montessori is 
currently dealing with the manual process of canteen transaction and gate 
pass monitoring around the school. During the first phase of the study, the 
researchers had an idea of improving the manual transaction and gate pass 
monitoring that has been currently using by the school. Specifically, it sought 
to (1) identify the functional requirements of the gate pass monitoring and canteen transaction system; (2) define the suitable design of user interface;
(3) determine the appropriate developing tool for the study. 
The second phase of the study entitled “Automated Canteen 
Transaction and Gate Pass Monitoring using RFID of St. Mary’s Montessori”. 
It aimed to provide an automated transaction and gate pass monitoring that 
will help the parents to monitor their child location and insufficient funds with 
the help of SMS notification. It specifically sought to answer the following 
questions: (a) How to determine the appropriate evaluation tool for the study? 
(b) How to evaluate the acceptability of the system with the use of the 
evaluation tool? (c) How to determine the appropriate hardware devices that 
should work well with the system? ",Method
"This includes the important contents such as the information that we've 
gathered. The following instruments or tools were used by the proponents 
ingathering data for the study. The proponents used this as basis for drawing 
conclusions or making assumptions. Some of these instrument or tools are 
 interviews, observations, internet research, library research, questionnaires, 
and consultant.",Result
"This chapter discusses in details the results of the evaluation of 
analyzing the data, data collection method, sample size and sampling method 
and the number of respondents.",Discussion
