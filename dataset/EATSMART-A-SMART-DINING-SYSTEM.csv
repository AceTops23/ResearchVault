"A restaurant in this day has the ability to compete with other businesses and companies. Some restaurants use different techniques and strategy. Some restaurants focus in the interior and exterior design of their restaurants to catch the attention of the people who passes by in their locations. And some of the restaurants focus in improving of their services or the ordering process like using some technology to help them work faster and easier.
Technological capabilities are now abundant than before. Wherever we go, different technologies are now implemented in order to make every work easier, reliable, and cost-efficient. There are lots of infrastructures to serve people including fast foods, canteen and restaurants which aim to catch the taste of citizens roaming around in specific places like schools, streets, malls and restaurants. Researchers came up to the idea of improving the process of ordering. Researchers developed an Ordering System to make the ordering process faster and reliable possible.
Ordering System is uses a traditional ordering method.  There are many types of ordering system like providing information to the customers whether on the phone, face-to-face, or in emails. Some restaurants has computer but sometimes they encountered problems compared to the usual way of work. 
",Introduction
"La Carmelita started in June 08, 2013, but established in May 2013. Mr. Gerel Joelson Limpengco is the manager of the restaurant but Mrs. Marirose L. Vicedo, the auntie of Mr. Gerel is the current manager of the restaurant. La Carmelita restaurant is located at 4009 National Highway Brgy. Patimbao Sta. Cruz, Laguna. 
It has a large number of customers, client aim to develop an ordering system. The client is the one who want to improve their ordering process. The La Carmelita Restaurant has problem of ordering because of its manual method of ordering. Hence, their used a currently manual processing of orders. La Carmelita decided to use an ordering system to a faster way using an android tablet. The problem of their current ordering system in this processing is the orders inside the restaurant. Rush ordering of customers, omitting of orders crumpled papers may reduce the reputation of the restaurant. The restaurant is currently lack of waiters, so it is hard for them to handle many customers. Getting order in the table then giving copies of order to the kitchen and in the cashier. It takes some minute to finish an order. So, Mrs. Marirose L. Vicedo, came to the point on have an idea to used an ordering system with unique process and limit the duration of getting order. So, the waiter can handle more customers.
 Developing an Ordering System with the use of modern technologies, the restaurant and customers may benefit with this new way of ordering. Make their ordering process faster, reliable and give accurate information in the 


users. With this process, the service of the restaurant may improve and may gain the trust of their customers. 
The first phase of the study aimed to provide the design an Ala carte called “EATSMART: A Smart Dining System” focusing take of customer order
and work efficiency. Specifically the study addressed the following objective: (a)to identify the functional requirements of the EATSMART: A Smart Dining System (b) to develop a computerized system that applies in a restaurant ordering service, which the waiter has the Android Tablet, assisting the customer to order in the Tablet without using of some papers or order slip. 
The parts of the cashier/manager in the system are calculating total amount of a specific customer with the table number entrusted by the waiter, and can view the history of transaction. In the kitchen’s panel, it was show the table numbers of the customers and their orders, the cook’s responsibility is to provide an estimated time or duration of preparing ordered foods in the waiter in the kitchen’s panel.(c)To develop a system that secures and stores data information of the restaurant. (d) To develop a system for customer to view menu of the restaurants prepared and make their order via android tablet.
On the Second phase the problem of the study. (1) How to test the developed EATSMART: A Smart Dining System in La Carmelita Restaurant. (2) How to develop and testing plan for the proposal and approval from the La Carmelita Restaurant for the full deployment of EATSMART: A Smart Dining System? (3) How to develop an evaluation tool that can be used in measuring the acceptance of the system as perceived by the target respondents? (4) 


How to identify and analyze the cost of the resources that were consumed on the development of the system?
",Method
"All studies needs reliable information and data to ensure that all the facts and knowledge to keep the legitimacy of information here intact. The researchers have used the following methods to collect data. 
Research Interview
The researchers conducted an interview with the employees as well with the manager to have information regarding their manual process at work. They also state some of the personal things regarding their nature of business, and we assure them to keep that in private as a sign of respect to their job privacy.
Library Research
Since there are some things that the researchers need in order to create system, they still search at library and read some books that was help them creating and improving the system.
Internet Research
The most influential factor for the researchers in creating the system is the internet since there are codes that they don’t know and the internet knows it. It is a great help for them to make the system well functioning. 
Software Methodology
Agile Development Cycle for developing the system. The Research methodology defined here is based on the methods used to collect information on the real world problem pertaining to on-line retail chain stores and to define system requirements. From the analysis study, understanding of the literature reviewed and analysis of questionnaires, was lead the initial 

requirements for the system. Evolutionary prototype is used as methodology for ADC. Once the initial requirements are ready, the next step is to design the system, followed by coding and testing.
",Result
"The following charts discuss the results acquired from the survey conducted to each user assigned for the use of the system. Data where gathered through the surveys conducted by the researchers. The following data were computed, analyzed and interpreted to come up with the desired results need to know if the system has satisfied the client. With this evaluation, using questionnaires, researchers were able to know the understanding of the respondents to the proposed system and be able to make the system suitable to the needs of the end users.
