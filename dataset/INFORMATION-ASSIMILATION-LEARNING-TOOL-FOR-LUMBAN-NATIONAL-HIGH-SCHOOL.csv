"As present times, the world is characterized by technological 
advancement and digital migration. Technology plays an important role in 
making the society a better place. Online system is helping people to lessen 
their work and to make lesser mistakes. These are working accurately and a 
user just need to program them with proper information and all gets done 
perfectly. 
Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application for the 
administration, documentation, communication, reporting and delivery of 
electronic education technology (also called e-learning) courses or training 
programs. Learning management systems play a major role in LMS allowing 
students to learn and develop online. E-learning providers use learning 
management systems to provide online education to their students in a wide 
range of different subjects. Online learning management systems allow 
educational providers to deliver high quality educational content to their 
students from anywhere, collaborate on class topics and assignments
remotely and let students access, store and send content.
An LMS is a software application or Web-based technology used to 
plan, implement, and assess a specific learning process. Typically, an LMS 
provides an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor 
student participation, and assess student performance. An LMS may also 
provide students with the ability to use interactive features such as threaded 
discussions and discussion forums.
Just like software is used to build websites, LMS are used to build and 
manage online learning platforms. Online E-learning providers use learning 
management systems to deliver content to their students via the Internet. 
Learning Management Systems are also used by students to deliver 
assignments, connect with teachers and measure their progress. Learning 
Management Systems are also used to store data, from assignments and 
projects to documents, schedules and more. In many ways, LMS act as a 
technological framework that let students learn efficiently online. One of the 
biggest advantages of using a LMS is that all of your organization?s content 
from lessons to videos, text resources and students? own work can be 
centralized for efficient storage, access and management. Online learning, 
from web-based classes to interactive lessons, simply wouldn?t be possible 
without LMS.
Most students nowadays also have access to the internet, and usually 
there are internet café near from schools. Some also have internet access 
within their own home. Students are mostly independent in their learning as 
lectures usually give out lecture notes, and further information are left for the 
students to discover on their own.
Since technology is leveraged for learning purposes, students and 
teachers interact with each other via online forums and threaded discussion. 
Students with better basic skills in the internet perceived the internet to be 
supportive of learning environment by using the internet for their learning 
tasks and also generally had better attitudes toward using the internet to 
improve their studies.
",Introduction
"Manual system is difficult and put stress on people to be accurate in all 
details of their work at all times. The problem being that people are not 
perfect, yet much of us wishing we were. Using manuals systems, the level of 
service is dependent on individuals and this puts a requirement on 
management to run training continuously for staff to keep them inspire or 
motivated and to ensure that they are following the correct and right 
procedure. Checking and reporting those data is tough can be timely and 
expensive. This is often an area where significant money can be saved by 
automation. The Developers of Information Assimilation Learning tool gives a 
different variety of features that can help the society in most useful ways.
The researchers seek to resolve feasible problems that a student 
encounters in studying. Having an overview to the problems, a school only 
has limited access of information and data. Gathering data through interview 
and internet research gave the researcher an idea to develop a self-made 
system that gives remedy and an aid to those students in need of special 
lesson. The old manual system of Lumban National High School requires the 
teachers to give exams and quizzes to the student which may cause noise. 
The teachers are sometimes to focused in reading the questions so that the 
students would have opportunity to cheat. The researchers made a study to 
resolve these problems that the student of LNHS encounter. Having an 
overview of different problems, which includes the school having a limited 
access of information of data, and having unorganized files for delivering 
assignments for students to download it to social media sites which make it 
hard from them to download it one by one and check it manually. With the 
help of Information Assimilation Learning tool it could provide a room for the 
teachers to save and upload their assignments for their students. Another 
problem is that some of the students could miss their lesson and having no 
handouts could have a student miss a topic and be late to the discussion it 
would be hard for the students to ask their classmate to know the topic taught 
by their teachers. With the help of Information Assimilation Learning tool it 
could provide a handout for the students by downloading files in easier and 
faster way even they missed the lesson. It could also help the students in 
advance reading for the next topic to be discussed by the teachers.
The first phase of the study aims to develop an Information 
Assimilation Learning Tool for Lumban National High School that would help 
teachers other way of teaching students and the students will acquire more 
knowledge. By using the web based system that?s fits the needs of the client 
by having some interview and data gathering. Following their demands what 
will be the process, features etc. to correspond what they want and using free 
LMS some features does not accurately match what the school needed. Using 
some open source Learning Management System doesn?t match the process 
of LNHS way of teaching. Having the Information Assimilation Learning tool is 
generally for LNHS, features and data are gathered based on what the school 
needed to develop the web based system and this will be mostly used in their 
computer laboratory. This web-based learning tool be able for the teachers on 
teaching and for their students to be more perceptive in learning. The web 
based system can use and access even though there is no internet 
connection, this means that Information Assimilation Learning tool can be use 
through offline. Thus, teachers will upload their module to the web-based 
system. The students choose module about certain category and lessons, 
after each lesson the teachers will activate the assessment, students will have 
access to their quiz, then after the students take their quiz, they can view their 
score and print it. Using this web-based system, students can still study and 
learn even though they don?t have class or the class is suspended. 
Information Assimilation Learning Tool for Lumban National High School will 
help teachers and students of LNHS in providing more efficient and 
knowledgeable education.
The first phase of the study desire to develop and design a Learning 
tool for LNHS using web base system that can manage information learning 
tools to improve and enhance the skills and knowledge of the students of the 
said school. Specifically, it aims (1) to develop a learning management 
system to increase the knowledge of the students of Lumban National High 
School; (2) to identify the development of the proposed system; (3) to 
formulate a procedure and guidelines in the testing accomplished the 
objectives.
Currently, the study that focuses to evaluate effectiveness and 
accuracy of the developed system. To prove that the developed system was 
effective it requires answering the following questions: (1) how to test the 
functionality of the system? (2) how to assess the Information Assimilation 
Learning Tool for Lumban National High School as perceived by the user? (3)
how to develop an implementation plan for the deployment of the develop 
system?",Method
"The researchers used materials such as books, manuscripts thesis and 
previous related studies to help make the study feasible. The researchers 
used materials such as books, manuscripts, thesis and previous related 
studies to help make the study feasible in providing sufficient data needed by 
the researchers.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interviews in LNHS to know the different 
problems that they encountered to gather information, ideas and suggestions
regarding to the proposed study that would help and to be more effective. It 
makes the researchers to feel that the data what they collected is true and 
honest and original by nature because of the face to face interaction.
Internet Research
The internet provides the researchers instant information on most 
topics. It enables the proponents to use and evaluate information as a tool in 
decision-making which are related to the proposed system by means of 
principles and functions.
Library Research
The library is one of the main sources of information for the 
researchers. Library materials are reflected to be truly legitimate and accurate 
for having more information. Library research is necessary for the related 
study. When we conduct our research in library we read the entire thesis book 
that made by the past students and we get some idea of how we build our 
project.
Consultant
The most effective means to learn the solution that should be taken 
action is consultation. The researchers mostly provided accurate information 
about the system as a whole thus; researchers gather client needs from 
smallest to biggest details for our system to be more progressive and 
successful in making the whole thing.",Result
