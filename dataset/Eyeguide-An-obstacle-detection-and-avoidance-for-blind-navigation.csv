"Technology is the collection of skills and techniques used to produce 
goods or services as well as accomplishing particular objectives, either for a 
scientific invention or a normal real-life application. This means that the use of 
technology is beyond man’s predictions. Most often, technology can be 
described as products, processes, and organizations. Computers and the
Internet are two good examples of technology. It has advanced to its peak, 
and it is progressing day by day. As the humanly available resources 
increases, and new devices are invented, the technology is being re innovated each day. In other words, technology is being re-invented by 
utilizing itself. The impact of technology in modern life is unmeasurable, 
technology is used in different ways and sometimes the way people
implement various technologies ends up harming our lives or the society we 
leave in.
Technology simplifies life in so many ways and everyone defines 
technology in their own way. To some people, it means complicated electronic 
devices. To others, it means the source of the radical changes that are 
happening in all phases of life. Others define technology as science applied to 
practical purposes. Some people fear to use technology while others see it as 
the source of longer and more complete lives. According to Eddy (2011) mobile applications commonly known as 
“apps”, are well chosen to be one of the fastest growing trends in Information 
System Industry. Users enjoy the variety of features that mobile apps can 
provide quickly and without introducing unnecessary complexity into their 
design. 
In addition to the above article, the usage of mobile phones has grown 
so massively. It is not a luxurious item anymore, it is now part of people’s
lifestyle. The types of the mobile phones are also various depending on the 
technology that it possesses. Smart phones are one of the turning point in 
history because it’s a huge addition of technology. Without smartphones, 
there would be no such thing as using internet on the go. IPhone and Android 
are two popular types of smartphones. A smartphone is a device that 
combines cell phone with a hand-held computer, typically offering Internet 
access, data storage, and email capability. This is useful for quick references 
like looking something up on Google or using Google maps in the car to find 
your destination. 
“Visual Impairment” is the inability of a person to see normally or 
properly. Others experience partial blindness and most of it leads to total 
blindness. It cannot be fixed by eyeglasses. The fact remains that even 
medicines are not enough to make a person recover from blindness and none 
has been able to do so. The person with this kind of situation adapts with his 
surroundings by means of touching and hearing, or else his movements will 
be bounded by little capacities.
Creating a device with the help of mobile phones for visually impaired 
people is much needed in their daily lives because it help to navigate and 
detect an object or obstacle. That is also because vision is one of very 
important sense a human needs to survive. Vision is the experience of seeing 
someone or something in a dream or trance or as a supernatural apparition, it
is a God given ability that enables humans to interpret the environment in the 
world they live in. Of all the senses, eyesight is the most active in terms of 
manipulating movements in daily activities. It is the special sense by which the 
qualities of an object such as color, luminosity, shape, and sizes constituting 
its appearance are perceived through a process in which light rays entering 
the eye are transformed by the retina into electrical signals that are 
transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve.
",Introduction,,,,,,,,,
"The researchers conducted a survey to determine the level of 
functionality and effectiveness of the obstruction detection device for the 
visually impaired people. The study used purposive sampling technique. It is a 
type of non-probability sampling technique that is most effective in getting 
data from a cultural domain with knowledgeable expert. The expected number 
of respondents is ten (10) visually impaired people. Six (6) of them are from 
Vibes Massage Center and the other four (4) came from different locations. 
The list of the visually impaired people in the massage center was taken from
its manager/owner Mr. Renato A. Tiosan.
",Method,,,,,,,,,
"The researchers conducted a research and gathered information to be 
able to identify the possible gap that brought the researchers to the developed 
study. This would help for possible information needed that could be helpful in 
making the application.
In this study, the researchers discussed the way of gathering data with 
primary and secondary data. For gathering primary data, the researchers 
gathered information by using different application that is existing in the 
market to be able to know what will be the possible problem that the 
researcher will encounter on designing the mobile application, and stand as a 
guide for the researchers’ study. For secondary data, the researchers gather 
data on library which provide a previous study that will help for the researcher. 
But library can’t give all the data that we need, so the researchers come up 
with searching on the internet with a reliable website. 
Library. This is one of the source which will help the study improve. It
contains a lot of books, periodicals, and other material for reading, viewing, 
listening, study, or reference. So, the researchers visited different libraries to 
gather information needed in the development of the development application. 
They browsed books and works for the better improvement of the study at 
university library and College of Computer Studies Research Lab.
Internet Research. It is the using of Internet information, especially 
free information on the World Wide Web, in research. So the researchers 
come up of browsing information on Google scholar, Philippine e-journal and 
lastly watching on Youtube that is related and needed to their study through 
the internet, and also for appropriate ideas needed for additional knowledge 
and ideas. The researchers concluded that visually impaired people have 
hard time navigating in an outdoor environment.
Consultation. In this process there has a meeting with an expert or 
professional, for more understanding. The researchers consulted with their 
adviser and experts on the field for the improvement of the study. Also 
researchers showed the update of their software and documents. 
Interview. This is a formal consultation usually to evaluate a person or 
gathered information to others to have an idea. So, the researchers 
interviewed first, some professor in CCS department who teaching and 
handling the subject related to their study, second is the owner of Vibes 
Massage named Renato A. Tiosan, lastly are some worker of Vibes massage 
named Janice Solano, Richard Salangga, May Ann Salangga and Daniel 
Lobres which is visually impaired people.
",Result,,,,,,,,,
"This section gives an overview of the main features and capabilities of 
the system. It provides enough information about the study.
The developed system entitled “Eye Guide: An Obstacle detection and 
Avoidance for blind Navigation” is a mobile-based application that maybe use 
by android phone users, which can help those visually impaired people to 
detect and navigate an obstacle in their front. It is very essential, to recognize 
a product for their daily basis, the study focused on the development and 
integration of the existing researches about object detections. The 
researchers conceptualized design for better coverage of surroundings and 
durable structure for the prototype.
This study used Arduino Uno – CH340 and Gizduino ATmega644, 
sensor in this study which is called the ultrasonic sensor. It is a sensor that 
uses sonic waves to determine the distance of an object. Sound travels at 
approximately 340 m/s. The specific brand of sensor that the researchers 
used is the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The distance of an object, as 
detected by the ultrasonic sensor, is half of the product of the sound velocity 
and the time it takes for the sensor to transmit and receive signals. The 
researchers have used the ultrasonic sensor because of its cheap price, large 
distance coverage and its capability to detect objects without considering their 
color unlike infrared sensors. To optimize the response of the sensor, the researchers have limited the distance that the sensor can detect into one 
meter. The device’s construction look like a simple walking aid and it offers an
audio output.
It has one sensor which can rotate at 180 degree, the ultrasonic sensor 
is placed at the top of servo motor which help the sensor to rotate. And it has 
a Bluetooth module which can connect to mobile phone, and compatible to 
arduino, it has simplified output directed to the mobile phone.",Discussion,,,,,,,,,
