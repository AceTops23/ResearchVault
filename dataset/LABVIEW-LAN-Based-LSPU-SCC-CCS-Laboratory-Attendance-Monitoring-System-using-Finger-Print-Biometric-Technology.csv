"The transformation of technology continuously makes the world move faster and easier. The use of technology is increasing day by day, people becomes dependent in the use different technology to accomplish specific task in our lives. With the technological advancement, many organizations were looking for a change to improve this method of handling a laboratory management.
Monitoring is the regular observation and recording of activities that takes place in a project or program. It is a process of usually gathering information on all aspects of the project. To monitor is to check on how project activities are progressing. It is both systematic and purposeful observation. Monitoring also involves giving feedback about the progress of the project to the donors, implementers and beneficiaries of the project. Another benefit of computer system monitoring is data gathering. Monitoring system is extremely important and is a key component of any computer system. Monitoring allows for proactive response, data security and data gathering and the overall good health of a computer system.
 Biometric technology is a complete attendance solution for organizations. These days, biometric technology is one of the most effective way of getting the time and attendance. It is used to recognize individuals based on their physical properties such as their hands, fingerprints, eyes and facial features. Biometric technologies are extensively used in corporate offices, educational institutes, colleges and other organizations for recording the attendance of students and employees. Although biometric technology has been around for many years, modern advances in this emerging technology, coupled with big reductions in cost, makes biometrics readily available and affordable to consumers, small business owner, larger corporations and public sector agencies alike.
A fingerprint scanner system has two basic jobs. It needs to get an image of your finger, and it needs to determine whether the pattern of ridges and valleys in this image matches the pattern of ridges and valleys in pre-scanned images. Only specific characteristics, which are unique to every fingerprint, are filtered and saved as an encrypted biometric key or mathematical representation. No image of a fingerprint is ever saved, only a series of numbers (a binary code), which is used for verification. Finger print is a unique physical attribute of your body. It is effortlessly identified and verified when someone claim to be others.
",Introduction
"Monitoring is a routine that is conducted on a certain activity to check its progress in real-time. In a university, one way of monitoring of an attendance in the computer laboratory is a challenging process. The Dean, teachers and repair staff manage the computer laboratory. In the CCS. In the (LSPU) Sta. Cruz campus, repair staff are currently visiting the laboratory to manually check one by if the instructor is teaching and also check one by one if some equipment were lost or damaged, In the other side, the instructor manually get a paper and check the student’s attendance and their activities on the computer by walking from one student to another student. Thus, need to develop a system which allows the repair staff to monitors the instructors, and the instructors to monitor the student’s behavior in a computer laboratory.
The researchers are able to formulated a general objective which is to develop and test “LABVIEW: LAN-Based LSPU-SCC CCS Laboratory Attendance Monitoring System using Finger-Print Biometric Technology” that will help the CCS instructors, CCS staff, student and its college dean. In line with this, research questions were formulated to aid with the development of the study 1.) How to develop an automated lab monitoring system for CCS LSPU-SCC? 2.) What tools should be used in developing the automated lab monitoring? 3.) How to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system?
In the development of the system, several elements are considered such as materials to be used, its structure, the user interface design and the cost to be spent. The first phase of the study aimed to design and develop the attendance monitoring system through the use of biometric technology to handle the lab management. Specifically, it aimed to (1) develop a module that can easily take the attendance of the student and Instructor, and LAN monitoring of the users respective desktop inside the laboratory; (2) to identify the appropriate programming language and database that would help for the development of the proposed system; (3) to create a survey questionnaire that will used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
This study proceeds to its second phase, to know the acceptability of the developed system entitled LABVIEW: LAN-Based LSPU-SCC CCS Laboratory Attendance Monitoring System using Finger-Print Biometric Technology to the intended target users such as CCS, repair staff, Instructor and students. It contains the objectives identified from the previous phase of the study. At this point, the researchers acknowledged the general problem; how to validate the effectiveness of the developed system “LABVIEW LAN-based LSPU-SCC CCS laboratory attendance monitoring system”, specifically, the researchers wanted to answer the following research questions: (1) how to test the functional requirements of the developed system? (2)How to assess the behavioral intention of the users in the developed system? (3) How to determine the cost analysis for the deployment of the system?
",Method
"This are the methods that used in conducting the research study. For gathering of data, the researchers made an unstructured interview with the people who used the laboratory. The researchers also used observation and materials such as books, manuscripts, thesis and previous related studies to get the information that was needed. The researchers also had a consultation to the teachers to know the hardware that will needed to develop in this research study. These are reliable sources that is full of information made the study become feasible. Another way to gather information is through the internet. This also made a big contribution in providing sufficient data needed by the researchers. 
The researchers took a deeper analysis on the problems that they encountered during the research. To be able to gather information that will used to the research study, the following method were applied:
School Library Research
School library is one of the source of information that the researchers used to gathering of data that was related to their system. The researchers went to different libraries to search if their research study is significant. 
Interview
 The researchers conducted an unstructured interview to gather information needed to the system. In this method, the researchers knew how the existing system will work.
Internet Research
 The researchers used the internet to gain more information about their research study. The Internet was the main source of the researchers to provide more information that was related and needed in the study. The World Wide Web helped the researchers to accomplish the supporting documents for the creation of the study. 
Observation
 The researchers observed the old process in the computer laboratories and study the current procedure during the laboratory class. The researchers then had an idea about the flow of their current process in the computer laboratories.
Consultation 
 With the help of a consultation, the researchers learned and acquired more ideas about the research study. The components and devices that are needed are also discussed to the researchers to know how each of them works. Coding, examples for the system. Checking of manuscript also taken up.
",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test result, along with the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discuss if the proposed system entitled “LABVIEW: Lan-Based LSPU-SCC CCS Laboratory Attendance Monitoring System using Finger-Print Biometric Technology” has fulfilled the needs of its client.
The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the survey questionnaire for the repair staff, instructors and students of the College of Computer Studies. This was done to acquire the necessary data to determine the usefulness and the effectiveness of the system.
There are different types of questions that were given to each category of the users. The researchers used a five-point Likert scale on the survey questionnaires.
