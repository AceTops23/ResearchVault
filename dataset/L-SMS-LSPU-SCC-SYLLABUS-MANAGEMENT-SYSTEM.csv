"The use of technology is increasing day by day, it all depend on the 
technology we used on various occasions to accomplish specific tasks in our 
everyday lives. Today various emerging technologies had been experienced in 
many different ways. On the other hand, it does not matter which industry one 
had to deal with. Technology can be used in a proper manner. So embracingit 
and learning how to use technology is very important and recommended. As 
the world keeps on developing, technology continually changed, what is 
working today might not work and not be efficient tomorrow. So it is better to 
stay up-to-date with new emerging technologies and learn how to embrace and 
use them in one’s daily life. Today, technology has made a very big change in 
the education world. With the invention of technological gadgets and mobile 
apps which helps people in making their jobs easier and efficient. Today, you 
can make a system that can be easily accessed and created something out of 
it that will make the job faster, easier and convenient.One of the most convenient ways to connect to other is with the use of 
the internet, the Internet connects computer like building invisible bridges to fill 
up the communication gap, it serves as a tool in which people use for easier 
transmission from one person to another. Partially in the academic working 
environment, the teacher deals with tons of paper work that they need to 
accomplish in due time. Releasing the deadline for submission of grades at the 
end of the semester is really a hard thing to do for them. Likewise, in the beginning of the semester, faculty are required to submit the syllabus which is 
indispensable for both faculty and students. This presume that the proponents 
embark to create a project study in which technology and the processing of the 
syllabus takes place with the use of an online system specifically online 
management system which plays a vital role in which helps people in the 
working industry to deliver a much more acceptable performance in terms 
handling the given tasks. A syllabus is a fundamental unit of a course to which 
both the students and the faculty members have to rely on during their day to 
day teaching and learning activities. It serves diverse purposes although 
primarily, it provides a road map of course organization and direction.Syllabus 
preparation starts from the release of program from the Commission on Higher 
Education to different colleges and universities. The College Dean is then 
tasked to disseminate it to the faculty members who conducted their own 
research in order to gather relevant data to be used in creating their own 
syllabus.
That is why the school believed that having a Syllabus Online 
Management System within the department is a great help in their everyday 
transactions and a tool in performing their duties to the university. The 
researcher has come up with ways that can help the school specifically the 
department in terms of creating their syllabus and making the work process less 
complicated. A Syllabus Online Management system is an online management 
system that can helped lessen the paper works done by the people who are 
involved in the process. In this system there are three specific accounts and
those accounts is created for the CIDQA unit of the university, Faculty
members and the Dean. Basically, the system can be improved the 
inconsistency in the manual process that is still being used.",Introduction
"In CALABARZON Region particularly in the province of Laguna, the 
state University that caters to stakeholders is the Laguna State of 
Polytechnic University when started in 1952. One of the performance
indicators of educational institutions is through the success of its graduates 
otherwise known as alumni. The responsiveness of the program offerings to
the needs of the industry can be measured through the employability of the 
graduates. The LSPU was first established as a provincial high school. On
June 10, 1983 it was converted into a state college, known as the Laguna
State Polytechnic College. From then on the Laguna State Polytechnic 
College grew bigger and better, several projects and infrastructure
developments poured in to LSPC. It opened four (4) satellite campuses 
through Memoranda of Agreements with the local government. The four 
campuses are Sta. Cruz (Main) Campus, Siniloan Campus, San Pablo City
Campus, and Los Banos Campus. In 2006, it became a state University.
Currently managed by the University president Dr. Nestor M. De Vera.
In LSPU, there are thirteen (13) Colleges (13) and one is the College of 
Computer Studies. It started as Computer Department in 2000, they offer
Diploma in Computer Secretarial and Bachelor of Science in Information 
Technology Courses followed `by Bachelor of Science in Computer Electronics 
and Bachelor of Science Office Administration. The University has started the 
implementation of vertical articulations which resulted to the movement of
some courses that was before in the CCS but are now move to the College of 
Business Management and Accountancy. Currently, CCS offered the following 
comes to wit, are Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Associate 
in Computer Technology. For almost ten years (10) of producing BS –
Information Technology graduates, tracing the status of graduates and their 
employment must be regularly monitored. It is also a measure in particular 
College to updates on their status and being also a model for all those students 
that they have in present time. The College of Computer Studies-LSPU Sta. 
Cruz, Campus has a manual procedure. It was first done by the faculty 
members individually.
Every department has its own process in passing the syllabus but the 
process in general starts with the faculty making the syllabus then passed on 
the CIDQA and lastly to the dean. The colleges has encountered different
problems regarding in keeping the syllabus reports, The main problem of the 
LSPU department are those syllabus reports were only kept in cabinets 
without any backup in the computer therefore the department encountered 
some loss of syllabus reports. Also as for the problem encountered mostly by 
the CIDQA is the time being consumed by the process of passing on the 
syllabus because of the late submissions, and as for the Dean they are having
troubles in the availability of the faculty member who handles the specific 
syllabus. The system helped the entire user to solve the problem such as
security and prolonged process of the syllabus reports.
Based on the information that the researchers have gathered, Colleges 
of the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus, (a) uses manual 
system of processing and keeping of all the records and reports as well as the 
needed information of the Syllabus. (b) Missing documents, unorganized files 
and slow retrieval of information were some of the problems they encountered 
with the use of manual system.",Method
"This includes the important contents such as the information that we've 
gathered. The following instruments or tools were used by the researchers in 
gathering data for the study. The researchers used this as basis for drawing
conclusions or making assumptions. Some of these instrument or tools we’re 
interviews, internet research, library research, questionnaires, and consultation.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interview to every department in the certain 
campus about the process, problem, and desired improvement of their manual 
process in making their syllabus. Each and every person interviewed gave all the 
information that the researchers needs for developing the system.
Internet research
The researchers also conducted some internet research to gain some 
additional information and to enhance our knowledge and ideas in developing the 
proposed system.
Library research
The researchers visited the library to have source of information and 
knowledge by reading different books related to the study being conducted.",Result
"This chapter discusses the technicality of the project, details of the technologies to be used and how the project will work.",Discussion
