"Technology has changed the business world many times over. In the 
information age, the advent of computers and the Internet has increased that 
impact significantly. Many businesses cannot even function without the use of 
computer technology. This impact is seen in nearly all areas of business, 
including human resources, where technology continues to have a significant 
impact on Human Resource practices. Human Resources is one of the 
departments that mostly use Management Information Systems in order to 
disseminate information faster, execute a faster transaction and strategy to the 
company with the use of Human Resource Information System (HRIS). 
In Tiwi Food Product Company, the company’s Human Resource 
Department is currently using a manual method of managing and recording 
employees information, monitoring employees attendance and recruitment of 
future employees. Meanwhile the Accounting Department uses the traditional
method to calculate the compensation of the regular and contractual employee. 
As the technology continue to innovate, Information Technology provides a 
solution to Human Resource Department which is Human Resource 
Information System (HRIS) to easily store, manage, generate, monitor and 
distribute information about the company and the employees. If it is used 
properly, employee expectations are clarified, and they are put in charge of their 
own development, since there is better communication and collaboration 
throughout the workplace.
Through implementing this systems it can help to automate the 
processes in the company, companies may actually change the fundamental 
structure of the workplace and the way that daily tasks are performed. HRIS 
are now capable of handling most of the complex but repetitive tasks that fall 
under the Human Resources Department, improving efficiency, saving space, 
and saving valuable human resource hours for more important and humanized 
tasks",Introduction
"It is important to coordinate and control major functions, departments 
and the business processes in any organization. Each of these functional 
departments has its own goals and processes and they obviously need to 
coordinate in order for the whole business to succeed. Human Resource 
Department has a big role on making any company successful. The Tiwi Food 
Product Company is a twenty year old company located at Sta. Cruz, Laguna, 
which has 530 employees and one of the largest and fastest nut crackers 
manufacturing in the Philippines that offers different variety of jellies, gummy 
candies, chewy bubble gum and many more. The company’s Human Resource 
Department uses a manual method on monitoring and managing their 
employees as well as computing employee’s salary to enhance the current 
system of the company. Hence, the researchers developed a web application
for the company’s convenience.
In developing a web application, it needs to consider several 
fundamentals such as development tools and software methodology to make 
to it effective and efficient. After identifying those fundamentals, the researchers 
aimed to design and develop a web application that will help the Human 
Resource Department to gather, monitor, manage, generate, distribute 
information, store and analyze information.",Method
"The Data collection method is the part of the study where the 
researchers collected important data about the company for the progress of the 
study.
The Internet Research -The internet is the major source of journal, current 
news, and books. Information on the internet can be brought up an up to date 
data immediately. It is a very versatile facility.Interview -The researchers asked a pre-planned questions to the clients about 
the company primary information and activities done by the Human Resource 
Department. The researchers also ask question that are needed to fulfill the 
stated problems. 
The information that we gathered were then analyzed and processed to 
identify the main problem and the solution to it. Due to it, the researchers would 
simply able to make a system that would fulfill the needs of the client.
The Library Research- The researchers searched in different libraries for a 
possible related literature and studies and gather information like codes to 
improve the system.
Observation - The researchers have observed the environment of the 
company and found out that the company still uses a manual method. To 
provide faster service and automate the manual method the researchers come 
up to an idea to help the company to solve the problems.

"This chapter includes the research methods used by the researchers to 
gather the information needed in the study as well as the software methodology 
use in creating the proposed system.",Discussion
