"As school buildings age, the challenge for maintaining school facilities grow 
further at a level where teacher and students’ performance are affected by the school’s 
physical environment deterioration. The challenges arise in both new and old 
buildings, though the types of issues are different. Old buildings more frequently face 
degradation issues like cracking walls, broken faucets, clogged water systems, and 
roof leaks. The problem is insufficient funds and some catastrophic climate condition, 
but for some reason, these problems may root from lack of maintenance management. 
The lack of maintenance management is caused by improper maintenance practices, 
staffing, and unorganized work order management. These facility problems will 
surely arise as times goes by, thus the need for maintenance will also arise. A school 
is necessarily required to develop and plan for these particular problems by going on 
through effective facilities maintenance. By assigning a department whose main focus 
is on management of facility maintenance, a school may work effectively on this kind 
of task.
For instance, the Physical Plant and Site Development in Laguna State 
Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus is the one who’s responsible for 
maintaining facilities in LSPU. The office manages the material provisions of the 
school: the school campus, library, laboratories, classrooms, furniture, equipment, 
comfort rooms, and canteen as the researchers as the vehicles used for travel 
purposes. They also manage the maintenance work order requested by other 
departments of the school. Maintenance management is one of the most important 
duties of Physical Plant and Site Development in LSPU Sta. Cruz Campus. It is 
because maintenance for facilities greatly affects student’s outcome and teacher’s performance. A simple delay, miscommunication, and misplacement of documents in 
their system of work will have a great impact on school facility’s well-being.
The study for a maintenance management system for a high number of 
organizations has been the focus of some researchers today. The maintenance 
management system provides these services: job request, work order, deployment of 
utilities, prioritization of task, scheduling, and generation of report for task 
completion. As the whole world continue innovation and development of technology 
for the improvement of an individual’s way of living, besides our perseverance for 
developing greater maintenance management, people also look for further 
advancement through automation, modernization, and computerization of systems for 
their office.
The growing use of technology, particularly computers have improved user’s 
operation processes, but some organizations are still using old and manual ways or 
techniques for doing their paper works. Using pen and paper is considered 
conventional, effective, and easy way of doing work since most of us are very familiar 
with it. But some studies proved that this kind of technique has a lot of errors due to 
human unavoidable mistakes. As the researchers go along with the fast-paced 
processes, people need to reduce human errors, more specifically to a maintenance 
management system. A simple human error can affect the whole system and it can 
cause misunderstandings with the data due to its unreliability. As of now, some 
offices, businesses, schools, and universities were looking for a computerized system 
for maintenance management.
Computerized maintenance management is a software system that aims to 
reduce this kind of manual errors. The system aims to computerize maintenance 
management processes of the office, thus reducing paperwork and automate other 
processes that are done manually. It will also improve their service through fact 
communication between the maintenance workers and people who request job orders. 
This system is intended to help maintenance workers of physical plant and site 
development in LSPU Sta. Cruz to do their jobs more effectively. This will allow the 
said department to track their maintenance operations.",Introduction
"Physical Plant and Site Development (PPSD) in Laguna State Polytechnic 
University Sta. Cruz Campus and currently located in Brgy. Bubukal, Sta. Cruz, 
Laguna. PPSD is responsible for maintaining facilities in University. The chairman of 
the Physical Plant Site and Development office in Sta. Cruz Campus is Mr. Danilo N. 
Daran. Maintenance management is one of the most important duties of PPSD office. 
The office manages material provisions of the school: the school campus, library, 
laboratories, classrooms, furniture, equipment, comfort rooms, and canteen as well as 
the vehicles used for travel purposes. They also manage the maintenance work order 
requested by other departments of the school. PPSD facilitate and support the 
university, mono technics and colleges of education to achieve their international 
goals and objectives. If higher institution of learning which to produce graduate which
will be able to compete in the national/international job market, there is need to pay 
more attention to the state of existing facilities in tertiary institutions. Moreover 
maintenance for schools’ physical facilities may contribute on the wellness of the
students as well as teachers and office staffs, keeping their performance right on track.
The Physical Plant and Site Development office ensures that the campus is 
safe, clean, functional and attractive. Their services are maintaining facilities, 
provisions of material, maintenance and reservations of vehicles. The PPSD works 8 hours a day to provide the physical provision of the school. Wherein, they accept job 
requests and assign personnel to do the task. To do this, the officials have to track the 
deployed utilities on their operations. They have to manage the personnel’s schedule 
to ensure that the facility management will maximize the utilization of time, making 
the maintenance service more effective. Managing facilities in school is one of 
important aspect of school educational system. Well-maintained buildings and 
complete educational equipment will allow students to be an achiever that can be 
known throughout the country or internationally. As well, maintaining a good 
university environment can help students feel motivated. PPSD continuously finds 
ways of improving its services and systems toward achieving more efficient building 
and grounds management as well as security and safety administration. School 
facilities improve the student experience, especially in the developing countries. In 
addition, fully equipped schools with well-maintained rooms, better utility service, 
suitable furniture has made better academic performance than other school with poor 
facilities. 
The current system of PPSD office using is manual operations. They are 
listing the work and job orders on the white board. They are also listing timetable of 
the campus’ vehicles. Before they list the work order, a representative from a college 
department having a report will go to their office. Moreover, a representative from a 
college department can do a phone call or a text message. The office will appoint a 
personnel to check the report to identify the problem. Once the problem is identified, 
the maintenance request is created and will be written on the list. The work order can 
be prioritized based on the difficulty on the task. In addition, the office is putting a 
milestones for the on the project schedule in appropriate places and link them to the
relevant tasks. When the work order is completed, it can be closed. Once closed, the 
work order is filed and will be kept in an unsecured cabinet. ",Method
