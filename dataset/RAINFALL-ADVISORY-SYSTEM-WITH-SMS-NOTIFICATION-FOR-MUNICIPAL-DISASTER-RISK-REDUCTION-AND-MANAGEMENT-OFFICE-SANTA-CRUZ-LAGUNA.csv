"Occasionally a new technology appears which promises to change our daily 
lives for the better. It improves the performance and gives faster services and creates
possibilities and options that did not previously exist. Through this, information 
system and new technologies has become a major or most important tool to improve 
efficiency and will accelerate the movement toward this direction (Alami R. 2019). 
In the Province of Laguna, flood management is a major problem especially in 
the town of Santa Cruz by the lack of current flood level advisory so it affects the 
community. According to Qomariyatus Sholihah (2020) floods are one of the most 
disasters that is feared by the people due to its higher water discharge and other 
impact such as carry waste materials and interfere to the community activities. 
With the advancement of today’s technology, there are some existing devices 
which helps the organization by providing information on the status of flood level 
from a given rainfall measurement and rainfall duration. A study by Caraig, Dimaala 
and Piamonte (2018) created a useful warning device that can give a warning signals 
when the water level arises and can send Short SMS Advisory to the citizens that is 
affected by flood.
Furthermore, for the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office 
(MDRRMO) the researchers proposed a project entitled Rainfall Advisory System
with SMS Notification with a Rainfall device using Esp8266 and Tipping bucket that 
focuses to design and develop a system that might help and provide an effective 
solution in rainfall monitoring, giving or sending awareness to the citizens that is 
prone by flooding.
",Introduction
"The Municipality of Santa Cruz is a 1st class Municipality in the Province of 
Laguna and located at Calios Poblacion Tres in Santa Cruz. It was divided into 
twenty-six (26) barangays with a total population of 116,605 people based on the 
2015 census. As the focus of the study, the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Office
(MDRRMO) was headed by Joshua Federick J. Vitaliz EnP. and administered by the 
office of the Civil Defense (OCD) under the Department of National Defense (DND). 
The department was divided into three (3) Divisions: (1) Research and Planning, (2) 
Operation and Warning (3) Admin and Training.
The Study focuses on the division of Operation and Warning of the 
Department, under this division are the first responders in any accidents or disasters. 
As their duties they needed to act to prevent further accidents due to the impacts of 
disasters such as flooding. Flooding is the most common problem in Santa Cruz 
especially to the areas which are near the riverside and bayside wherein the possibility 
of much flooding. ",Method
"Population of the Study
The respondent of the study has a total of two-hundred and fifty one persons 
that includes – one designated Office Administrator of MDRRMO, (25) Random 
Citizens of each selected areas, and the front-liners of Barangay Local Government 
Unit of the Low land areas which contain its – (1) Barangay Captain, (1) Secretary, 
(1) Treasurer, (2) Councillors, (5) SK Councillors, (1) Barangay Driver, and (14) 
Barangay Police Officers.Data Collection Method
The study entitled “Rainfall Advisory System with SMS Notification” needed 
accurate and mathematically significant data from Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction 
and Management Office of Santa Cruz, Laguna. In the process of data gathering, the 
researchers were gathered through collecting, and analyzing. The researchers used the 
following methods of gathering the necessary information and requirement.
Observation
The researchers used this method to gather information that focuses on the 
current state of technology and current process of the MDRRMO in terms of
responding when an incident occurred and how they take actions to prevent further 
accidents due to natural or man-made accidents. The researchers took down the 
necessary information and analyzed the nature of work and processes that is involved 
in the current state of technology and situation of the office.
Interviews
In this method, the researchers used semi-structured form and face-to-face 
verbal interchange to generate insight concepts. The researcher started by 
interviewing the Head Department and one of the Admin-staff of Research and 
Planning. The client gave the information to the researchers including their majorproblem and challenges in terms of storing data, generating of reports, rainfall 
monitoring and giving of awareness to the low land areas when a hazard occurred 
especially flooding, which needs to perform force evacuation. The office was 
experiencing hard times in terms of spreading awareness to the citizens of Santa Cruz, 
and especially the most affected areas. According to the interview, the rescuers travel 
every affected area using a siren while announcing that they needed to proceed at the 
Evacuation Center. The researchers used this method to gain knowledge regarding the 
experience, and situation of the client. The researchers formulate some ideas and 
came up with this study.
Library Research
The researchers visited the library of LSPU, FEU, and de LaSalle and gathered all the 
necessary data that are needed to develop the system. The researchers are able to find 
related studies about rainfall advisory system.
Internet Research
The researchers also conducted internet research and visited different sites to 
gather information regarding the computation of rainfall amount, information about 
the Esp8266 and tipping bucket from different studies, other related studies and 
literature to gain more knowledge in developing the proposed system. With the help 
of internet, the researchers gathered a lot of ideas and information that would help 
them for the development of the study.
Surveys and Questionnaire
Surveys were given to the I.T experts and respondents of the study in order to 
satisfy the researcher’s goal, in this method; the researchers used an Online Survey 
due to the pandemic. The instrument was used to gather opinions, feedback towards 
the developed system. In the preliminary survey the researchers identify the majorproblems of the office in terms of measuring, monitoring and giving awareness to the 
flood prone low land areas that can possibly use the rainfall advisory system and 
rainfall device. With this research instrument, the researchers also determined the 
platform’s usefulness, significance and acceptance, solidifying the viability of the 
developed system and rainfall device.",Result
"This chapter presents the result and the main findings of the study. It shows 
how the researchers answer the research problems and how it was achieved. The 
methods used in the development of the study was also discussed in this chapter. 
Research Objectives
The aims of the study is to design, develop, test and evaluate the user 
acceptability of the Rainfall Advisory System with SMS Notification that will provide 
accurate data from the Rainfall device, to handle, store, exporting of current and 
previous data of rainfall intensities, forecasting, monitoring, and generate SMS 
notification",Discussion
