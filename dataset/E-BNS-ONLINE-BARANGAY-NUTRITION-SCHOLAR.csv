"Modern technology has revolutionized the way people throughout the 
world convey and communicate. This transformation hassled to a system of 
globalization which has fundamentally changed modern society in both good 
and bad ways. The most important technological change over the past 20 
years is the advent and popularization of the Internet. Internet connects 
millions of individuals around the world and permits a different kind of 
availability in ways in which the world has never seen. Industries, like 
companies, are able to do business with people from other countries and 
continents while families and friends are able to communicate with each other 
regardless of their distance and location. Also, information sits at the 
fingertips of every person with the use of mobile computers and mobile 
devices.
The significance of innovation in people’s everyday lives is obvious. 
This is because of the way that in today's dynamic world, existence without 
innovation is good for nothing. Technology, which basically refers to bringing 
together tools that ease creation, use and exchange of information, has a big 
and important role of making people’s tasks easier as well as in solving their 
problems.
Records management is the systematic control of an organization's 
records in order to meet operational business needs, statutory and fiscal 
requirements, and community expectations. Effective management of 
corporate information allows fast, accurate and reliable access to records, 
ensuring the timely destruction of redundant information and the identification 
and protection of vital and historically important records. Information is every 
organization’s most basic and essential asset, and in common with any other 
business asset, recorded information requires effective management. 
Records management ensures information can be accessed easily, can be 
destroyed routinely when no longer needed, and enables organizations not 
only to function on a day to day basis, but also to fulfill legal and financial 
requirements. The preservation of the records of government for example, 
ensures it can be held accountable for its actions, that society can trace the 
evolution of policy in historical terms, and allows access to an important 
resource for future decision making.",Introduction
"The process of getting information of children in census is manual. 
This process is the same at the Municipal Nutrition Action Office (MNAO) at 
Victoria Laguna. The Municipal Nutrition Action Officer (MNAO) assisted by 
37 Barangay Nutrition Scholars (BNS). 
In the development of the web based system, the researchers used 
the applicable methodology to the study and the appropriate tools needed to 
develop the system. The researchers also identified the database that can 
be used in the development of the system and the cost analysis. The 
researchers used the descriptive method to gather all the data that is needed 
and the software methodology they used was Spiral Methodology. The 
researchers also identified the sampling technique that will be used to identify 
the population of the study.
Recording is the process of computing data or translating information 
to a format stored on some form of storage medium. For example, in different 
Barangays in Victoria Laguna, they are using paper and pen to record the 
information of the all Scholar. The BNS who assigned to monitor the Nutrition 
of the Children by getting the height and weight of a one child, after that they 
need to compute the status of the children. The BNS are also compiling the 
information of the children manually and sending it to Ma’am Jessica Marcelo 
the Head of Municipal Nutrition Action Office using traditional way. Thus there 
is a need to develop a system which allows the BNS, and MNAO record the 
proper document process that they need.
The researchers are able to formulate a common objective which is to 
develop and test “E-BNS: Online Barangay Nutrition Scholar Record 
Information System” that will help the BNS, and the MNAO. In line with this 
research question were formulated to aid with the development of the study.
In the development of the system, several elements are considered 
such as materials to be used. It’s structure, the user interface design and the 
cost to be spent. The researchers have accomplished identifying these 
elements. The first phase of the study aimed to design and develop the 
record information system. 
The BNS don’t need to go in Municipal to get form instead they used 
the system, and the study made their work easier. The system will served as 
the easiest way to generate and compute the status of all the scholar. Also the communication is easy to notify the co-BNS by using the newsfeed tab 
in the develop system. The BNS will be the main user here it is because the 
BNS is the one to input the scholar and only them to update the status of the 
scholar. The head will be the viewer to review the reports and notify the BNS 
if the report have an error or not satisfied to the result in the report.
This study proceeds to its second phase to know the acceptability of 
the developed system entitled “E-BNS: Online Barangay Nutrition Scholar 
Record Information System” through web – based system to the intended 
target users such as all BNS, and MNAO of Victoria, Laguna. It contains the 
objectives identified from the previous phase of the study. At this point the 
researchers acknowledge the general problem, how to validate the 
effectiveness of the developed E-BNS: Online Barangay Nutrition Scholar 
Record Information System, specifically wanted to answer the following 
research questions: 
(1) How to test the functional requirements of the developed system? 
(2) How to assess the behavioral intention of the users in the developed 
system? (3) How to determine the cost analysis for the deployment of the 
system?",Method
"To gather the data needed in the study, the researchers used different 
activities and methods, one of which was brainstorming. In brainstorming, the 
researchers focused on gathering different ideas. Discussion about each 
thought was also done to bring more ideas out, make ideas clearer, or even 
solve the existing problem of the client.
Internet Research
The researchers conducted research on the Internet about record 
information system and looked for examples. Through this research, the 
researchers were able to gain information about the BNS (Barangay Nutrition 
Scholar) Program and they had an idea of what their system would be after 
the development.
Library Research
The researchers conducted research in the library and looked for 
documentations about record information system. Through this research, the 
researchers needed to read literatures and thesis books about different 
studies with regard to technology and I.T. projects. The information the 
researchers got from researching in the library and the documentations 
served as their reference and guide for the development of their the system.
Interview Research
The researchers performed a key informant interview with the 
Municipal Nutrition Action Officer, Ms. Jessica Tabucod Marcelo, to know 
about the problems they have been experiencing through the current manual 
methods, and the improvement they want. Aside from this, the researchersalso asked her for other information relevant to the study and the actual forms 
needed.
A personal interview was also conducted to the Municipal Nutrition 
Action Officer to know more details about the process. The researchers 
interviewed the Barangay Nutrition Scholars to get an in-depth details about 
the process in Operation Timbang and the preceding steps.
Consultant
With the help of a consultant, the researchers learned and acquired
more ideas about the study. The components and devices that are needed 
are also discussed to be able for the researchers to know how each of them 
works. Coding examples for the system are also taken up.
",Result
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test result, 
along with the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discussed if the 
system entitled “E-BNS: Online Barangay Nutrition Scholar Record 
Information System” has fulfilled the needs of its client.
The researchers used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the 
survey questioner for the MNAO and BNS in the Victoria Laguna. This was 
done to acquire the necessary data to determine the usefulness and the 
effectiveness of the system.
There are the different types of questions were given to each category 
of the users. The researchers used a five-point Likert scale on the survey
questionnaires.",Discussion
