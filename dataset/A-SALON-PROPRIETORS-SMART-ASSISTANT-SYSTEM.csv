 Albert Einstein said, “Technology has become appallingly obvious that 
our technology has exceeded our humanity.’’ It has become the first source of 
information all around the world. First, there are multiple negative effects of 
technology on human, but the most frightening is that it interferes on human 
relationships. In fact, nowadays there were less and less communication 
between people. They do not talk as much as they used to, and when they do, 
it was mostly non-verbal. One of the most challenging decision a business 
owner’s face nowadays is whether to continue using the manual process for 
business transactions or change into a computerized system. Computerized 
system can further be classified for those specifically created for the company, 
which usually cost more because of the planning, and development stages
made to arrive at the best system designed specifically applicable to the 
business operations’ unique processes.
Management Information System is a network that requires managing 
themselves that provides information efficient and effectively. Management 
system are computer systems that is used for managing five primary 
components which includes hardware, software, data, procedures and people
