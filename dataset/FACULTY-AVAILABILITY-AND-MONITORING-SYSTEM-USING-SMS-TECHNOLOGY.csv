"Technology and its advancements become unstoppable by doing various tasks in organizations and offices. The innovation of a monitoring system helps people do their job in a more organized and efficient manner. It continues to improve production and minimizing the difficulty of the task. Technology was often considered as the key to a nation’s economic growth which affects the citizens and the prosperity of the nation.
The development of high technology including computer technology’s internet and telephone helped to conquer the barrier of communication and bridge the gap between a person and the world. The modernization of technology to is evident in different industries like business and in the education sector. It helps people to create a system that can determine and monitor a specific group of people.
In schools, students and faculty members are the most important individuals. Communication between a student and faculty members are important. Hence, sending a text message that will prompt in the monitor inside the faculty room is a leap in today’s technology. It is also used in school mostly faculty members are using computers. In manual way of checking of the faculty availability members, they need to wait a couple of time to approach them. 
The faculty members are constantly disturbed by the students which distracts their concentration to work and their need of privacy. Many students 
 are just looking through the door to see if their instructor is inside the faculty room, one of the options of the student is to check the availability of their instructor by looking at the schedule of each classes one by one.
",Introduction
"The College of Computer Studies in Laguna State Polytechnic University – Santa Cruz Campus is composed of 1,100 students and 20 faculty members. The students encounter several problems when it comes to communicating with their professors. Most of the time faculty members are unavailable because of their teaching load. Hence the researchers developed a system entitled “Faculty Availability and Monitoring System using SMS Technology” that resolve the said problem. The problem is how to communicate easily to faculty members without waiting or spending a long time outside of the faculty room.
 The first phase of the study addressed the following questions: (1) what are the problems that the college of computer studies students and faculty encounter with regards to their communication? (2) How will the researchers develop the system that can solve the issues and problems in things of communication.? (3) What are the hardware and software needed to create a system for college of computer studies and faculty to use as a tool for communication? 
For the second phase of the study, the following research questions was answered; (1) What to develop an evaluation tool can be used in evaluating the Faculty Availability and Monitoring System using SMS  

Technology in terms of effectiveness? (2) How to evaluate the acceptability of the system using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)? (3) How to test the functionality of the Faculty Availability and Monitoring System using SMS Technology as perceived by the user? 
",Method
"After the approval of the title proposal, the researchers had a brainstorming in order to get started with their study. During the brainstorming they had a discussions about the software and hardware that they are going to use, the information they needed to gather, and the things they needed to do in order to achieve their goal.
 In the collection of the necessary data, the researchers conducted an informal interview from the CCS students and faculty members. Brainstorming and discussion was done to gather the information that was used to assess the appropriate software and hardware that was used in the developed system.
Interview 
 The researchers conducted an interview in Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa Cruz Campus College of Computer studies that help to gather the needed information from the student.
Observation 
 The researchers conducted an observation of the current operating procedure that gave the researcher’s additional perspective and better understanding of system procedures.
 The researchers also conducted an observation to see the flow of communication between faculty and students in CCS, and also to observe the effects of the communication gap.



Internet Research 
 The internet provides the researchers instant information on most topics and layout. It enables the proponents to use and evaluate information as a tool in decision-making which are related to the system by means of principles and functions.
Library Research
 The library served as one of the main sources of information for the proposed study of the proponents. Some information came from the books, previous studies, newspaper found in the library of LSPU Santa Cruz 
Campus, to enhance their knowledge and understanding of library which the proponents find significant with their proposed study.
Questionnaires 
 The fact-finding technique was used by the researchers to collect data and other information’s through questionnaire and feedbacks. The hardware as well as the software involve in the study was tested and evaluated by the students and professors of CCS.
Consultant 
 With the assistance Specialization Expert the proponents learned and gained more ideas about the proposed study in how it work as well as the components and devices that would be needed and used in building up the proposed system and capable to recognize whether the project was feasible or not.
",Result
This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if the study entitled “Faculty Availability and Monitoring System Using SMS Technology has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client.,Discussion
