"Technologies emerged to introduce various ways of advancement in today’s world. One example of this is computers which can do anything easily. As the world advances, technological development arises in the field of Information Technology. One of which is computer application technologies in which aid human for their daily needs. Some applications tend to entertain, some reduces human effort, some reduces complexity, some assist in decision making and some tend to automate manual system. 
Automating a manual system has many advantages. It has a huge influence in the way people accomplish their daily task. It is used in different fields such as business, health, government and education. In the context of the educational field, taking the attendance of the students on a daily basis and maintaining the records is a major task. 
 Attendance monitoring has been a huge process used by different institutions including schools, businesses and organizations. Attendance monitoring is the process of recording the occurrence and presence of a person in class, meetings, events and other proceedings. Since a school is the basic foundation of knowledge, it is exceptionally important to have an accurate automated attendance monitoring system which will constantly record every student’s attendance.
 Monitoring student’s attendance is very significant for it helps parents and guardians assure that the students are attending their classes and is inside the school premises. It also helps in preventing possible negative effects that a student’s absence from a class can deliver. An accurate and efficient attendance monitoring system that notifies the concerned individuals with an accompanying portability makes an attendance monitoring system more functional. Being a student comes with a responsibility which includes following the rules and regulation of their respective school. It is also very important to record and monitor their violation to practice their discipline and to become a responsible student and citizen in the future that follow rules set by an authority.
 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of the automatic identification technologies in trend nowadays. There is a wide research and development in this area trying to take maximum advantage of this technology. In the coming years, a lot more new applications and research areas will continue to appear and develop. This sudden interest in RFID also brought about some concerns, which includes mainly the security and privacy of those who work with or use tags in their everyday life because it RFID has specification that some devices don’t have. RFID has for some time, been used to access control in many different areas, from asset tracking to limiting access to restricted areas. Although the use of RFID systems in educational institutions is not new, it is intended to show how the use of it came to solve daily problems inside the university. (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 2008).
 Android phones are being widely used worldwide today. Most people rely on their android phones most of the time since these phones offer different and exemplary functions which makes everyday tasks easier so that many of us use these kind of devices.
Short Message Service or SMS is a text messaging component of a mobile phone even before android phones become popular. A lot of people rely on their phone’s SMS component as a form of communication with each other. Since a lot of people are always checking text messages on their phones, having an SMS based notifications make it an advantage to its users.
",Introduction
"Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) Santa Cruz Main Campus is still using manual checking of attendance and violation by using the traditional pen and paper. There are numerous disadvantages of using such systems that can include losing of data because it may be misplaced, get ripped or other unwanted circumstances. It can also cause inaccurate gathering and recording of data. Since attendance is one of the factors embedded in the curriculum to compute the grade of the students, monitoring this should be accurate and vital. Hence, a simple mistake can be crucial for both the student and the teacher. 
One of the problems of the university is the monitoring of the attendance of the students who entered the gate and the university’s premises which currently have a total population of 9790. In addition, some professors and security personnel encountered problem in reporting whether the student/s committed a certain violation since they need to report it by personally in the guidance office. Since, it was inconvenient for them to visit the guidance office and report students who have violation which can consume time so that their only choice was to record the violation on a sheet of paper. 
It is very difficult to manage the attendance and violation to determine whether each student meets up with required lecture attendance. Most of all, parents are not aware of the exact time of their child’s arrival and departure in the school. For some reasons, some students prefer going to computer shops and play games rather than entering their classrooms.
The guidance office also monitors the students’ violation as reported by the security personnel. There is a list of violations available in which includes, not wearing proper uniform, improper haircut and not wearing their ID. Students would repeat these violations after noticing that security personnel isn’t recognizing their respective violation since they would change shifts and with the volume of people entering the school, they would not notice it sometimes. 
These instances were not reported to the parents or guardians because the way of informing them is still the traditional way in which they invite the parents through the students in which the school can communicate with the professor about the absenteeism and violation of the student. This process takes a long time and sometimes parents are not able to come because of certain reasons which include work and household chores. Hence, the researchers came up with the idea about attendance and violation monitoring.
The researchers developed a system entitled “Student Attendance and Violation Monitoring System using RFID with SMS Notification” to solve certain problems such as attendance and violation information loss, storage, and secured information. Through the use of student attendance and violation, this helped the parents and guardians about the student’s attitude in class. It also provided a fast way of informing the parents about their child anytime and anywhere. It helped the instructor by having a faster way of recording the attendance because the system would do that for them. It helped the guards to lessen their works by having an easier way of checking the student violation. Lastly, it helped the guidance personnel by having a faster way of tracing a student about their violation in order for them to be more responsible about the student violation.
With this system, it improves the recording and monitoring of students attendance and violation using RFID that imbedded in the student’s ID. They also come to class earlier since the exact time of entering the campus was recorded by the system. All students were required to wear their RFID cards to take attendance and this made them more disciplined in terms of wearing their ID’s. 
",Method
"In order to obtain and to gather data that was necessary in this study, the following methods were used by the researchers in order to make the study feasible:
Library research
The researchers visited and went to different schools to conduct study and differentiate their study to other study. (Please look at Appendices D for the proof).

Internet research
Another method used by the researchers was through researching the internet to improve their knowledge according to their developed study. The internet has been very useful to the researchers’ study since it gives additional knowledge in creating of codes and the design of the system, and collecting some of the related literatures and studies. 
Interview
The researchers also conducted interviews with the respondents to be able to know the common problems being encountered using the current system. The researchers conducted interview to the LSPU-SCC Guidance Counselor to know about the violation of the student, to the Chairman of safety and security and Campus Director to gathered much knowledge about the university rules and policy, to the university guards about the security and the manual process of monitoring of violation and to the university students and instructors to know the problems encountered and requirements needed. (Please look at Appendices C for the proof).
",Result
"This section discusses the methods used in developing and evaluating the software. The researchers used the Prototyping model as the design process when it comes to the study. 
It discussed the flow of system’s functionality. It involves six phases: Requirements Gathering and Analysis, Quick Design, Build Prototype, User Evaluation, Refining Prototype and Engineer Product. In this model, it is assumed that all the requirements may not be known at the start of the development of the system. This model allows the users to interact and experiment with a working model of the system known as prototype.
At this stage, there was a reasonable understanding of the system and its needs are unclear or likely to change too further understand and to meet the requirements in developing the system. After the prototype has been developed, the users and clients are given the opportunity to use the prototype.
The researchers conducted an interview with the LSPU officials, faculty and students to know their existing system and know the problems encountered to find a way to solve these.
