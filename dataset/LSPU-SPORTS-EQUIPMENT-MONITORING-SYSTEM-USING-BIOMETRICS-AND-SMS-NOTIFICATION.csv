"Technology make life easier for people everyday. They help us to do 
tasks quicker and communicate with others just like one click. From the 
invention of the wheel to the internet, technology has been a great factor on the 
way our progress has grown. With more technological advances just around 
the place, our civilization will continoue to grow faster than ever before. 
Computer technology is the most influencial technology nowadays. Many 
companies and organizations used computers. To the used of technology is 
emerging day by day. Small business are expand through the used of 
computers and they are being indenpent.
The Sports Development Office in Laguna State Polytechnic University 
Sta. Cruz Laguna is a department that provides equipment to the players of 
basketball, volleyball and other sports that needs specific sports equipment. 
The said office was using manual process of monitoring the equipments.
Monitoring is one of the hardest thing to do especially checking and 
organizing of equipments that is in different storage. Monitoring giving comment 
about the progress of the project. Monitoring system is extremely important and 
is a main component of any computer system. Monitoring allows for positive 
response, data security and data gathering and the feedback of a computer 
system.
Fingerprint scanner is needed to make the monitoring system more 
secure in which it is mainly use to identify each individuals and differentiate with 
one another. Likewise, Short Message Service (SMS) is needed to use as a 
service for monitoring system for sending notification and announcement over 
wireless network.",Introduction
"The Sports Development is a department/office that provides equipment 
to the players of Basketball, Volleyball and other sports that needs specific 
sports equipment. The Sports Development Office has a manual method of 
monitoring of equipment and the record of the equipment. Manual monitoring 
was conflicated to do. It cause a lot of time to monitor everyday if the equipment 
is complete.
Monitoring, checking and observing the quality of the equipment over a 
period of time was hard for them to do every day. In schools, universities and 
college, the way of monitoring of an equipment and the name of the borrowers 
in Sports Development Office is stimulating process. The Sports Development 
Head and staff are ones the responsible for checking the equipment in the stock 
room. In Sports Development Office in Laguna State Polytechnic University, the 
staff and head of the office are always checking the number of equipment in
stock room if the equipment are complete or not. The Sports Development 
Office has the research questions that formulated to help the Sports 
Development Office in Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa Cruz Main 
Campus. (1) how to develop an automated sports equipment monitoring system 
for Sports Development Office in LSPU-SCC? (2) What tools should be used in 
developing the automated sports equipment monitoring system? (3) how to 
assess the effectiveness of LSPU Sports Equipment Monitoring System using Biometrics and SMS Notification in terms of: a) Quality factors b) Perceive of 
ease of use (POEU) c) behavioural intension and d) actual use.?
In the developed system entitled “LSPU Sports Equipment Monitoring 
System using Biometrics and SMS Notification” the researchers were able to 
formulate an idea that will help the Sports Development Office in Laguna State 
Polytechnic University and the students/teachers that borrow the equipment.
The first phase of the study aimed to design and develop systematized 
borrowing and monitoring of equipment through the use of fingerprint biometrics 
to secure the borrow equipment in the borrowers. Specifically, it aimed to (1)
develop an automated sports equipment monitoring system for sports 
development office in LSPU-SCC. (2) to develop a system that could identify 
the programming language that used in the development of the system. (3) to 
create a survey questionnaire that will use to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
proposed system in terms of: (a) Quality factors (b) Perceive of ease of use 
(POEU) (c) behavioural intension and (d) actual use.",Method
"Data Collection Method
The researchers used different kinds of method in collecting of data like 
internet and library research and interview in Sports Development Office.
Library Research. The researchers collected information or data in the 
library since the past thesis in the library helped in developing the system and 
the document. Also the researchers used these studies us to a references in 
the present study.
Internet Research. The researchers gathered an information using 
internet. Information from the internet where taken like background of the 
company or the client. Also internet research helped to have a good and well made study.
Interview. The researchers gathered information through interview 
because this is the easiest way of collecting data.
Consultant. To come up with the study, the researchers did a consultation
to the adviser to know how the system should be done. Also they checked the 
system if it is functional and working. The adviser also checked the document 
if it is the same with the system.
Observation. The researchers did an observation in the Sports 
Development Office when the borrowers want to borrow the equipment and use
the gym they need to log in the log book.
",Result
"The chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the tests results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses the 
study entitled LSPU Sports Equipment Monitoring System using Biometrics and 
SMS Notification has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client. 
The study aimed to validate the effectiveness of the developed system 
for the Sports Development Office in Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa 
Cruz Campus. The researchers used specific questions:
