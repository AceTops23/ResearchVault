"In this new era of technology, it is difficult to imagine people working without 
technology or assistance of computers. Computes already become a daily 
activities needs for personal, educational and professional. Technology makes 
almost all our daily routine works faster than before. Without a doubt, human 
interaction has been influenced of new technological devices, because it can 
provide accuracy that lessens the time of work for every human being. It also
provides better opportunities in any field, either business or in our daily lives.
Current technology like spreadsheet application can be useful in data 
management, but this technology cannot be secured and not easy to manage 
when it comes to big data and cannot be used in terms of centralizing data. Pen 
and Paper method of technology can cause a lot of time in gathering data before 
recording it in a spreadsheet. Everything is constantly changing because of 
technology and through the years technology is also continuously advancing.
In this world full of technology, it helps in data management or data 
gathering today using our technology, the bigger population, the data gets bigger 
and bigger and this technology can be used to gather data and can be used to
avoid pen and paper technology records. Record management system is 
commonly used, it is because they can easily manage the data like the information 
of the specific person and saves it in centralized database using web or object. 
Increasingly, with the aid of technology and record management system, this technologies are widely used in commercial industries, companies and other 
organization like schools and other local government agencies along with some 
technologies. To enable organizations to make more-informed in their business 
they are now using these web based technology for record management for them 
to easily gather data in one place and easily manage the gathered data",Introduction
"The Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) was founded on 1952, it 
became a university way back year 2000 with all four (4) campuses. There different 
department and student services that LSPU provide and one of the department 
and services that provides service for the student is scholarship and financial 
assistance (SFA) that handles scholarship and financial assistance and it is under 
the supervision of Sandy Jessie Lynn B. Leobrera, the Director, Scholarship and 
Financial Assistance of Laguna State Polytechnic University. The duties of this 
services is to assist all the student who claim or rewarded a scholarship for them 
especially to those people who can’t afford the expenses in school. The
scholarship started since our government give all the university a fund for the 
student who is qualified in scholarship program. 
There are 2 types of scholarship and financial assistance, this includes the 
Internal Scholarship which the campus provides the Financial Assistance of the 
students for their achievement, e.g., if the student is a Dean's Lister he can get an
internal scholarship which is offered specifically for Dean's Lister. The other one is 
the external scholarship, this scholarship provides financial assistance for the 
students provided by external sources such as political scholarships (governor,congressman, mayor), scholarship funded by the private entities (PLDT-SMART, 
APEX, UCPB etc.), government scholarship (Municipality, Barangay, CHED etc.) 
This includes some Local Government Unit that gives a scholarship for the student, 
Free Tuition that government applies to the State Universities, and some private 
person or company that also give financial assistance to the students that qualified 
the requirements and limitation. The student can now applies for many scholarship 
and financial assistance until they reach the total of 15,000 pesos only per student, 
except for the students who has already apply under the DOST scholars, ESGP PA scholars and under CHED Full-Merit.
The scholars consists large number of students in all four (4) campuses. 
The LSPU Santa Cruz Campus has 5700 students and 1800 have a scholarship,
1800 student is the Internal and External Scholarship only not included the free 
tuition which all of the student claimed, with the existing process there are using
which uses the manual way to record which the record is saved to the excel 
spreadsheet per category after the enrollment process and searching in the 
category one by one to find data of the scholars. With this process there are 
struggling to find some records of the student and time consuming in generating 
reports. According to the interview conducted by the proponents the client use 
software specifically MS Excel for the payroll and to put the data needed in 
monitoring their scholars. They manually count the total number of scholars and
they submit a copy to the director.
",Method
"Population of the Study
The study was tested in all LSPU Campuses to be able to see if the 
developed system is effective. Before that the researchers conducted an interview 
to gather some data in different population of the study. First the researchers 
interviewed the Director of the Scholarship and Financial Assistance in Siniloan 
Campus, and she provided some information like problems encountered in the 
process they are using, and also she provided the list of students in Siniloan 
Campus, the researchers also interviewed the three (3) Chairman of the 
Scholarship and Financial Assistance that is included to the population of the 
study, Chairman of the Santa Cruz Campus, Mrs. Bernardita M. Rosales provided 
the application form of every student when they are applying scholarship, she also 
included why they still used pen and paper method, it is because some of IT 
student conducted an interview but the student didn’t come back with the solution 
on the process of manual method. Same as the other two (2) Chairman in San 
Pablo Campus and Los Baños campus, they included the process of pen and 
paper method, that comes up with the problem of generating report, because of 
bad handwriting of student in application form and some information is not correctly written, for example, the student fill up the course, some student only write BSIT 
which can be BS in Information Technology or BS in Industrial Technology. 
The researchers also interviewed a few student who has scholarship, the 
researchers discovered some student has multiple scholarship that was not notice 
by the Scholarship and Financial Assistance Office. The researchers ask a 
question on some student who has a course of Industrial Technology, “What will 
you write in your course in application form?” Some student answers “BSIT” and 
then they quote “Nakakatamad isulat, kasi mahaba”. After the students, the 
researchers also interviewed Student Assistant, Technical Staff and Employee, 
that encodes all the information of the student, and they quote “Mahirap manghula 
ng course ng mga studyante lalo na ung BSIT, minsan wala pang gender, at 
minsan pangit ang hand writing ng studyante kaya mali spelling na naeencode 
namin”.Data Collection Method
To support the descriptive developmental the researchers obtain a deeper 
observation and analysis on what are the problems that they have encounter 
during the research, designing and data gathering process. To be able to gather 
information needed in the study, the following methods were applied:
The researchers gathered information through library research, internet 
research, and interview. This gathered information helped the researcher to 
complete the study. The following instruments were used in order to make the 
study feasible:
Interview – Interview is a verbal questioning. The researchers interviewed the 
Director of the SFA for gathering information in the manual process and other 
important information of the clients, like background and other information. This 
process of fact finding techniques helps the researchers to gather the current 
situation of them and use it to identify what are the needs of the study.
Library Research – The researchers used unpublished studies and past studies
that help them get the ideas for their study and also past studies that are related 
to the study. Library helped the researcher to study in easy and affordable way. 
There were also a lot of study to choose in the library that the researcher read. 
Also, the unpublished studies of the past graduates were only found in library. 
Unpublished studies made the researcher compare their work to the other work for 
improvement and other recommendation for the study.
Internet Research – It helps the researchers to gathered ideas, concept and 
application they needed in the study by the help of internet. Internet has a wide 
range for research, it is your choice how to use it. It has unlimited information that 
this researcher used to be able to enhance their study, research about what 
programming language to be used even the hardware requirements. There are a 
lot of random knowledge and information all over the internet the researcher 
identify which is just true and applicable to the study, verify and compare the information to the others to form a fact and improved it in your own way of 
researching using internet research. And also the researchers gather some foreign 
literatures and foreign studies that is related to the study",Result
"The researchers completed all the information presented in this chapter 
based on the evaluation of the staff, student, that have pre-evaluated using the 
system. 
There are currently 85 scholars/students from four (4) different campuses
of LSPU and 15 admin user (Director, Chairman, Staff, OJT and IT Expert, the 
scholars will update their own personal account, request a scholarship using the 
system and admin will manage all the information and the account of the scholars 
from different campuses of LSPU. 
The researchers use Statistical Mean and Standard Deviation to calculate 
the evaluation results gathered.",Discussion
