manual system that gets a lot of papers and documents to compile, a lot of information 
to collect that causes a long period of time to get the papers of the requester. In order to 
avoid time consuming with the help of modern technology will make it easier than ever 
to participate in open discussion with the municipal staff. If the citizen is wanted to ask

",Introduction
"The MPDC Santa Cruz has  Frontline services. First, Securing Certificate of 
Site Zoning Classification this service is for anybody who wishes to establish 
Building/s or develop a particular area. Second, Securing Zoning and Locational 
Clearance for Building permit this service is for all enterprises and private persons 
constructing a new building or applying for expansion/ renovation. Third, Securing 
Zoning Locational Clearance for Business Permit this service is to ensure that the 
3
enterprise is allowed in the chosen location. The last one is Issuance of Subdivision 
Development Permit this service is to developing a subdivision.
The main problem of the department where those written reports of ongoing and 
outgoing papers which where only kept in the cabinets without any backup in the 
computer, therefore the department encountered some loss of files or data. Also, they 
have no system used to speed up the processing of people's documents and not all 
systems are computerized, just in the process of completing the Information system. If 
this process continues, the staff will feel very tired and time consuming. The citizen 
who is requesting some documents will complain because of the prolonged release. The 
system will help the MPDCO Santa Cruz to solve the problems such as security of 
information and error keeping of documents. Although it must have the copy through 
cabinet, since they were using of manual method of sorting, keeping and compiling the 
documents through the use of folder, it took a lot of effort and time to gather data that 
they were seeking. Lastly, they were having trouble in terms of retrieving and 
monitoring information.
From all the consultations and interviews that the researchers gathered so far, 
there are many problems they are facing mostly due to this pandemic that’s happening 
right now, they sometimes cannot communicate with the applicants due to the lack of 
manpower and they can’t handle the manual site zoning clearance. The other problem 
is validating and getting requirements because sometimes the applicant didn’t have the 
full details of each requirements which lead to back and forth coming in the office 
which lead to inconveniency.",Method

The researchers used different techniques in able to gather data from “Municipal

designing of system such as interview, library research, internet research, and 
consultations.
Interview

interview is one of the most widely methods of conducting primary research. With this 
type of interview, the interviewer will clearly understand the information answered by 
the interviewer.
Library Research
The Library Research was used by the researchers to gain ideas about our 
proposed system as guide on gathering information. The library that the researchers 
visited is the main library of the campus which is the Laguna State Polytechnic
University. Through the use of books, other thesis, and some previous research studies, 
it will help the researchers to get some ideas in their proposed study. As cited by Baldev

some idea and information that the researcher can use.
Internet Research
The Internet Research was used by the researchers to browse in the internet. 
They gathered information to be used in the proposed system. It enables the researchers 
to use and evaluate information as a tool in decision making which are related to the 
proposed system by means of principles and functions. The googlescholar, 
researchgate, academia.edu, was the most helpful sites for the researchers. The 
researchers also read some journals, articles, blogs, and published thesis that is related 
to their study. The information gathered was a big help and used for the related

taken action is consultation. The researchers were able to know if the proposed project 
was feasible or not. They will able to know how it will work as well as the components 
and devices that will be needed used in building up the proposed system. The 
researchers gathered some more recommendation and information within consulting 
their adviser and subject specialist. They also give an advice, ideas and what kind of
