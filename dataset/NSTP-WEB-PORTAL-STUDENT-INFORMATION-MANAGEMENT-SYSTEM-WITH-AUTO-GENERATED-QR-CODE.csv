"In our world, technology has the greatest effect in education, medicine, 
transportation, entertainment, and other fields all benefit from technological 
advancements. It is used by people to reduce the amount of work they do as well as 
the amount of money they make. Technology is significant in everyone's life because 
of its daily use as a means of transaction, machines, and innovation such as cell 
phones, tablets, and computers that are useful to everyone in terms of communication, 
learning, and teaching.
The National Service Training Program (NSTP) of Laguna State Polytechnic 
University Sta. Cruz Campus (LSPU SCC) was headed by Mr. Mario C. Pasion Ed. 
D. as the Chairperson and Mr. Jethro N. Austria Ed. D. the Reserve Officer’s Training 
Corps Unit (ROTCU) in the university. 
Since the number of students enrolled in the said subject is increasing, 
according to the researchers' interview, the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) 
has 800-1000 students enrolled, and the Civic Welfare Training Service (CWTS) has 
1200 students enrolled, the management must manage the students' records. The 
management is having problems maintaining the students' records, especially on the 
registration due to its lost and misplaced. Due to a lack of a proper database system 
that can handle all of the records securely, old files such as lists of students who 
graduated from the National Service Training Program (NSTP) and Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps (ROTC) are being discarded.
The management continues to use a manual method to document student 
information and results, as well as attendance and production. Following that, they would encrypt all of the information using excel on a single computer run by a single 
person, which will take time to document all of the information of all of the students 
participating in the NSTP and ROTC Unit. Thus, the proponents suggested a system 
that entitled” NSTP Web Portal Student Information Management System with Auto 
Generated QR Code ” that includes a system that can records information that can 
lessen the time in recording data, a system that can help them easily trace the needed 
information to generate reliable information on time.
Due to the circumstances, the researchers devised a solution for the NSTP 
office's problem called ""LSPU-NSTP Student Record Management System,"" which 
deals with all types of student information, academic records, college information, 
course information, curriculum, batch information, and other resource-related 
information. It keeps track of a student's information from day one to the end of the 
course, which can be used for monitoring, attendance tracking, course progress, 
completed semester years, upcoming semester year curriculum details, test details, 
project or other related events, and final exam results; all of this information can be 
used for future references. The main goal of this software framework is to aid in the 
creation and production of a better performance for the existing National Service 
Training Program (NSTP) system at the Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. 
Cruz Campus. This type of system can become more successful over time in 
collecting data and ensuring that it is maintained for obvious reasons such as 
preventing student complaints during online registration and displaying an Auto 
Generated QR code that tracks student attendance.
",Introduction
"The National Service Training Program (NSTP), also known as Republic Act 
9163 or the NSTP Act of 2001, is a law that aims to improve civic awareness and defense preparedness in youth by improving their service ethics and patriotism while 
receiving training in any of the three program components, the (1) Civic welfare 
training service (CWTS) is a program designed to increase students' civic awareness 
by instilling in them the importance of service and dedication to the welfare and 
betterment of all community members. (2) Reserve Officer’s Training Corps (ROTC) 
in the Philippines is one of three components of the National Service Training 
Program, the civic education and defense preparedness program for Filipino college 
students. (3) Literacy Training Service (LTS). 
The LSPU-NSTP is a Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Main 
Campus (LSPU-SCC) extracurricular mandated program located in Brgy. Bubukal 
Sta. Cruz, Laguna. This curriculum focuses on preparation and closely tracks each 
student's attendance as well as uniform fees. Students will be given a registration form 
by the officer in charge in order to be officially enrolled. If a student misses three 
days of formation, he or she will be dropped from the subject unless there is a fair 
excuse. Furthermore, due to the office's procedure, officers are still having difficulty 
keeping track of their attendance. By writing the name and course on a piece of paper, 
the appointed officer will keep track of attendance.
Mr. Mario C. Pasion, Ed.D., Chairperson of the National Service Training 
Program (NSTP) at Laguna State Polytechnic University Santa Cruz Campus (LSPU 
SCC), and Mrs. Nori, Mr. Pasion's secretary and the office in charge in CWTS, Mr. 
Jethro N. Austria Ed. D. were interviewed by the researchers. The Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps (ROTC) Unit at Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz
Campus (LSPU SCC) Admin stated that the ROTC and CWTS management are still 
using the manual method of manually encoding data into Microsoft Excel. As a result, 
the researchers described the study's overall problem: how to have a framework.
",Method
"Population of the Study
The respondents of the study comprised of the students of the LSPU NSTP at 
Sta Cruz (Main) Campus. Respondents were selected through Quota sampling. As 
stated by Aprameya (2016) Quota sampling is a sampling method that is a non probabilistic method where the survey population is being divided into mutually 
exclusive subgroups. People in each subgroup are thus not in random, they were 
selected by the researcher or interviewer who is conducting the survey.
The respondents of the study were taken from the Students, Cadets Officer, 
CWTS office, NSTP Chairperson, ROTC Unit Office. These respondents know about 
the problems associated in this study. They could help the proponents with extra 
assess of the collected data. The table shows how the researchers computed the 
percentage and frequency of their respondents.Data Collection Method
To collect all information from all relevant sources on how the proponents 
find the answers to the research problem, design, and evaluate the outcomes; the 
following methods were used by the researchers to make study feasible:
Interview
On the 5th day of March, the proponents conducted an interview at Laguna 
State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz. Laguna with Mr. Jethro Austria, the cadets 
officer, Mr. Mario C. Pasion and his secretary for gathering information needed in 
making the proposed system to give some viewpoint and understanding about the 
current manual process of managing grading sheet, student information. The 
proponents determine the specific problem of the client and possible solution with it.
Internet Research 
 Since it has a large collection of information that is accessible anytime the 
proponents used internet. The proponents read some previous journals, articles and 
published thesis to gather different information associated to the propose study 
through visiting websites such as science direct, Google scholars, plus groups etc,
Library Research
 The proponents read previous study, thesis and books at Laguna State 
Polytechnic University-Santa Cruz Campus’s Library on March 6, 2020 in order to 
have a vision and idea on the layout in the development of the system. 
Expert Consultant
 The knowledge of the people who have expertise in fields that the researchers 
will undertake can greatly help in gathering data raw data. The opinions and 
constructive criticism of people will undoubtedly assist the researchers. One of the 
best ways to further improve anything is to make sure to ask for advice or help from 
people who know more than him.
Observation 
Observation is a useful fact finding technique that the researchers can employ 
in undertaking the research. Observation requires the researchers to see the different 
problem of the current method and provide the solution to fix or improve the current 
method for the benefit of those people who are using the current method.",Result
"This chapter presents the result of the survey questionnaire that was done in 
the implementation phase. It also discussed how the study achieves the research 
objectives.
Research Objectives
The management is having problems maintaining the students' records, 
especially on the registration due to its lost and misplaced. Due to a lack of a proper 
database system that can handle all of the records securely, old files such as lists of 
students who graduated from the National Service Training Program (NSTP) and 
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) are being discarded and also the 
management continues to use a manual method to document student information and 
results, as well as attendance and production.
The study aims to develop and assess the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on 
an automated system that handles online registration. The Study aims to design and 
develop a Web Portal Student Information Management System that will help the 
NSTP (National Service Training Program) to have an automated system for 
registration, managing the student’s information and heaving an Auto Generated QR 
code that monitor the attendance of the students.",Discussion
