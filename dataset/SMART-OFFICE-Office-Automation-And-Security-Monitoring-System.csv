"As technology grows and develop, creative innovations also grow. 
These changes make people’s lives easier and more convenient. As a result, 
different emerging technology are being developed to ease the task and lessen 
the time of how people and do their everyday lives. With this technological 
advancement, a lot of industries are looking for ways to cope with this 
advancement and improve business transactions and processes to its highest 
level.
Business people are usually fond of their works and usually spend their 
time mostly in their office feels like it’s their second home. Office is the place 
where business transaction happens and important files are kept, which are 
really important to keep the business going on hence it really needs to be 
managed and secured properly. With the security in the office, it ensures the 
safety of employees, client files, assets and confidential documents. Security in 
an office is really important because corporations, businesses and government 
offices are often the target of sabotage, unlawful entry and theft. Thus, security 
is highly need in this kind of environment to prevent this from happening.
The Cashier' Office of Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) Sta. 
Cruz Main Campus processes the transaction of the university with regards to 
money. They receive the payment for all the transactions in the university such 
as payment fees for the enrollment, paycheck, etc. With regards to the security of the office, it uses the standard and most 
common security system which requires a person to use a key to get into the 
office. It is open early in the morning and is accessible to anyone. However, this
existing security system has disadvantages where it can be easily forged and 
stolen.
Therefore, a more secured system for access control should be 
modernized to enhance the security purposes of the office. A more reliable 
security system should be provided by enhancing door access by having a 
secured automation of door lock, identifying authorized persons who can enter 
the office by using biometrics technology to provide a higher degree of security 
compared to the conventional way and a security system that is also energy 
efficient that will conserve unnecessary use of electricity by controlling the 
power line of every electrical appliances through smart socket.",Introduction,
"Efficiency and security is the ultimate concern in every transaction in 
office. Security precautions is applied which is the standard security system that 
requires a person to use a key to access the office. With the development of 
technology and the continuous improvement of a person’s living standard, 
besides in pursuing greater security, people are also in pursuit of automated, 
intelligent and convenient systems for their office where electrical appliances 
can be controlled by a person without going to the electrical appliances to turn 
the power manually.
In the development of the system, various elements are considered such 
as materials to be used, its structure, the user interface design and the cost to be spent. Currently, the researchers have accomplished identifying these 
elements. The first phase of the study aimed to design and develop a 
systematized security system through the use of biometrics technology to
enable security against intrusion and to provide controlling of appliances 
remotely that will lead to improve usefulness of the office. Specifically, it aimed
to (1) develop a system that could identify the authorized person who can enter 
the administration office which will improve its security; (2) to develop and design 
a door access security system based on fingerprint; and (3) to develop a 
security system that is also an energy efficient entry system. 
This study proceeded to its second phase in which the researchers 
developed the system entitled “SMART OFFICE: Office Automation and 
Security Monitoring System” - containing the objectives identified from the 
previous phase of the study. At this point, the researchers acknowledged the 
research general problem, how to validate the usefulness of the developed
system, specifically sought to answer the following research questions: (1) how 
to fulfill the functional requirements of the system? (2) how to test the developed 
system on the LSPU Cashiers Office? (3) how to assess the acceptance of the 
user in the developed system? (4) how to create an implementation plan to be 
followed in the testing and implementation? (5) how to identify the cost that was 
consumed on the development and implementation of the system?

"Data Collection Methods
The researchers obtained a deeper analysis on what are the problems 
that they have encounter during the research, designing and data gathering 
process. To be able to gather information needed in the study, the following 
methods were applied:
Library Research
The researchers visited the library to have a detailed research and also 
to read different books and materials that are relevant to the study being 
conducted.
Internet Research
The researchers conducted research with the use of the internet to gain 
some additional information and to boost the knowledge and ideas about the 
developed system. The researchers browsed the internet thoroughly and found 
some relevant sites which helped them for further understanding of the study. 
Some relevant sites that researchers found are Google Scholar and 
ejournal.ph. With this, they found ideas and designs that were implemented in 
the system.
Interview
The researchers conducted an interview to the Administrative Officer I 
of Cashier Office of the LSPU Sta. Cruz Campus, Mr. Efren Balandra, who 
directs the cashier office. The researchers asked questions about the 
procedures done, problems encountered and the requirements needed by the 
cashier office with regards to their security. Mr. Balandra carefully explained the 
processes that are done and the difficulties encountered by the staffs in terms of security. The information gathered were then analyzed and processed to 
identify the cashier office’s problems and the requirements that are needed to 
solve it. Due to this, the researchers were able to get a glimpse of what the 
personnel needs in order to make their office up to date in terms of security.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire was prepared by the researchers to determine the 
acceptance of the respondents. The respondents answered the questions 
based on the following criteria: Quality Factors, Perceived of Ease of Use 
(PEOU), Experience, Perceived in Usefulness, Attitude, Behavioral Intention, 
Actual Use which follows the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).",Result,
"This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of the test results 
acquired from the surveys conducted by the researchers. It also discusses if 
the study entitled, SMART OFFICE: Office Automation and Security Monitoring 
System has satisfied and fulfilled the needs of its client.",Discussion,
