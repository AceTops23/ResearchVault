"Technology is vital in this generation. The increasing use of technology 
came as a boom in different forms of social media. Social media is a digital tool 
you use to connect with other people around the world. Similar to a flipped 
classroom, educational technology is also making it easier to students to engage 
in mobile learning. Portable devices, such as smartphones. Every individual must 
acquire knowledgeable things. Educational software and applications have grown 
more adaptive. Education also evolve using of mobile technology as device, it 
become profitable for every user that want to learn with mobile technology.
Even so, the technological advances that exists contemporaneously are 
making huge changes in today’s society. The businesses are starting to lean 
towards the computerized ways of doing transactions and processes, the 
educators are now using computer devices in teaching process.
One of technology’s most engaging and interactive breakthroughs this 
decade is the emergence of virtual reality (VR) platforms. For those who are not
aware, virtual reality in technology today refers to computer systems that allow a 
person to immerse himself in a makeshift 360-dimension environment using VR 
materials, with the most common one being a headset.
Virtual reality has rapidly become one of the most exciting new computer 
technologies - exercising a strong hold on the popular imagination, attracting 
hundreds of researchers, and spawning a booming industry. This study explores 
the social implications of VR technology. It traces the history of Virtual Reality is a 
technology which allow user to interact with a computer-simulated environment, 
be it real or imagined one and it is an artificial environment that is created with 
software and presented to the user in such a way that the user suspends belief 
and accepts it as a real environment. (VR) deals with our senses with a computer 
generated virtual environment that we can explore in some fashion and then 
relates it to general issues in the study of the effects of new information and 
communication technologies. The book examines VR's relationship to advanced 
research and development, to education and the entertainment industries, and 
finally to cyberpunk and youth culture.
",Introduction
"Bible story is something that everyone should experience. Nonetheless, 
people have a tough time, even though they possess an explicit idea they tend to 
forget what they are taught, showing no strong emotion and forgettable for people 
of young age, likewise when the children told that they want to examine and read 
something, suddenly it turns something having control over someone, which 
makes them feels scared.
The study is made because the researchers believed that people 
nowadays, particularly those who are in the 21st century are not aware in Bible 
story and verses. The researchers made a possible idea when it comes to 
familiarization of words which comes from the Bible. The game entitled “The Bible 
Warrior using Virtual Reality” targets to answer the following questions;",Method
"The Data Collection Method is the part of the study where the researchers 
collected important data about the progress of the study. And also the researchers 
use the following methods to gather the important information that will help them 
making the capstone project entitled “The Bible Warrior (Virtual Reality)”.
Internet Research
The researchers used technology to research information to help the 
researcher by using internet to find related studies and literature that is relevant to 
their study and also to get additional learnings in using different software 
applications that was used in the development of the android game entitled “The 
Bible Warrior (Virtual Reality)”.
Library Research
The researcher visited the library to have a detailed information and 
research to find materials that is relevant to the study being developed. The 
developers used this kind of method of gathering information in the improvement 
of the developing application.
The researchers search for a possible related literature and related studies 
for improvement of the document.
Software Development Model
Software development is the procedure of PC programming, reporting, 
testing, and bug settling required in making and keeping up applications and 
structures bringing about a product item. Software development is a procedure of 
composing and keeping up the source code, however in a more extensive sense, 
it incorporates all that is included between the origination of the coveted 
programming through to the last indication of the product, once in a while in an 
arranged and organized process. Therefore, Software development may 
incorporate research, new advancement, prototyping, alteration, reuse, re designing, support, or some other exercises that outcome in programming items",Result
"This chapter consist of result presentation and analysis of data gathered to 
answer the problem of the study. The researchers used percentage and weighted 
mean test of independence to evaluate the factors affecting academic success of 
selected grade twelve (12) student in St. Therese School of Arts and Science, Inc. 
In order to support and answer the problem of the study, the table shows the profile 
of the students of St. Therese School of Arts and Science, Inc. in terms of age and 
strand.",Discussion
