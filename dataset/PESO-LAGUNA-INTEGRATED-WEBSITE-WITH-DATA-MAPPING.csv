"Technological developments have influenced every division of society, 
including the process of searching for employment it has made it easier to work 
remotely and it’s also opened the talent pool for recruiters. Preferably than spending 
hours leaning on through classified ads, job seekers now are able to use social media 
and job sites to not only look for jobs but also slimming their searches down to specific 
industries or even companies. The internet has also made it simple for job seekers to 
position themselves out there, showing their own resumes and skills. Technology has 
not only made it stress-free for job seekers to seek out job advertisements. Technology 
has helped make attempting to find jobs more convenient than ever, with a 
web connection job seekers are ready to search for jobs anywhere within the world. It’s 
not only also simpler to look, but also applying for a jobs at the press of a button. This 
inclines to present as a problem for not only employers searching for exceptional 
candidates, but also job seekers themselves who are competing with hundreds or 
thousands of other job seekers.
Technology has changed the entire recruitment and job search process for better 
or worse. For recruiters and hiring managers, it’s easier than ever to find candidates to 
suit niche skills or even sway candidates who might not be actively job searching. Job 
seekers can even reach out directly to employers, create online profiles to attract 
recruiters and apply for jobs with the click of a button. Based on the concept of the 
current trends, the researchers will use this information technology to bring innovation 
in searching jobs and generating of reliable and comprehensive reports based on the 
data from different users that will help both parties. 
",Introduction
"Finding jobs that most closely fit the interests and ability is kind of a difficult 
task for the job seekers. The difficulties arise from having incorrect data on the 
organization’s objective, their work culture and current job openings. Additionally, 
finding the proper applicants with desired qualifications to fill their current job 
openings is a vital task for the recruiters of any organization.
Unemployment today is common among all organizations which hinder in 
finding a job suited with their abilities and passion. It refers to the people who do not 
have a job, have actively looked for work in the past four weeks, and are currently 
available for work. (Amadeo, 2018). However, job mismatch is a complex phenomenon 
that exists when there is a lack of equilibrium between the characteristics of the 
employees like knowledge, field or skills that does not fit to workplace requirements 
and responsibilities (Velciu, 2017). It affects the workforce employment in terms of 
work productivity, wages, human capital and development.
According to the statistics, the percentage of unemployed in the Philippines has 
dropped to 5.2% percent in the March quarter of 2019 from 5.3% last year. From the 
number of unemployed composed of 2.20 million, it was down by 118,000 people. At 
the same time, the labor force of employed persons was down from 62.2% to 60.2 %. 
The labor force includes the service sector with 58.1%, agriculture sector with 22.1% 
and industry sector with 19.7%. The average unemployment rate in this country was 
8.34% in 1994 until the year 2019. With this rate in comparison in the first quarter of 
2000, it increased with 13.90% and its lower record from the fourth quarter of 2016 
was 4.70%.The Public Employment Service Office (PESO) was establish it serves as 
referral and information center for the various services and programs of the Department 
of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and other government agencies. The PESO is a non free charging multi-employment service facility or entity established or authorized 
consistent to the Republic Act No. 8759 otherwise referred to as PESO Act of 1999.
(DOLE, (2016)
With the increasing number of unemployment rate and the worsening effects of 
job mismatch every year nationally, it is rarely possible for implementing agencies like 
the DOLE and PESO fulfill the needs of insufficient number of jobs. The DOLE is 
committed to providing better and appropriate jobs for the Filipinos. Still, the number 
of unemployment is continuously increasing.
The PESO Laguna Integrated Website can be useful to solve problems that they 
encountered especially during job fairs and creating reports. It can be used to reduce 
time and lessen some storage bins. The system is an efficient way in collecting, creating 
and sending files from one office to another, it can also lessen time and faster way in 
registration and lessen some paperwork. It has reliable data that will secure the 
information of applicants and company profile.
The Laguna Integrated Website focused on reducing the papers on the office 
through creating their own information and uploading files. The proponent’s aims to 
solve the following problem (a) Problem in encoding, filing and storing of NSRP
(National Skills Registration Program) forms and monitoring the status of the 
applicants. (b) Problems in announcing and requesting of Job Vacancies and job fairs. 
(c) Companies are having a problem in gathering of information and checking details 
of applicants. (d) Problems in creating and submitting of reports.
",Method
"Population of the Study
Population can be explain as a comprehensive group of individuals, institutions, 
objects and so forth with have a common characteristics that are the interest of a 
researcher. The common characteristics of the groups distinguish them from other 
individual, institutions, objects and so forth. Sometimes population can be counted 
easily, which is called finite population. (Rafeedalie, 2007)
The distribution of the number of respondents was formulated using Likert scale 
model and Quota Sampling technique. The Province of Laguna has 30 PESO offices 
and a Provincial PESO each Municipal PESO has 2 to 3 employees. The researchers 
seek the help and knowledge of two IT professionals for the feedback about the 
developed system. IT professional has 1.70% with the total of 100%. The data served 
as responsible in answering the preferred evaluation sheet to the accessible population.
Data Collection Method 
Interviews 
The researchers gathered information in developing the system by interviewing 
the Training Coordinator of the Provincial PESO Engineer Rodson del Mundo. An 
interview was done with the PESO staff. First, a letter was sent to the different PESO 
Head for approval to do the interview. Then, a face-to face interview was conducted on 
the scheduled date. A questionnaire was prepared to make sure that essential data 
needed for the study were gathered. The interview was held at the different Municipal 
PESO office.
Internet Research 
The internet has unlimited information which the researchers use to be able to 
improved our study, research about programming language to be use in developing the 
system. The proponents manage to acquire some related studies and literatures that are 
related to the topic at hand by visiting online journal and web articles .Most publish 
works for both local and foreign origin were acquired this way. 
Library Research
The researchers used the University Library and CCS Research lab to search 
some ideas that contributed to the proposed web system and also to search for some 
related studies. The Information gathered from the related studies help in building the 
supporting documents for the proposed system.
Observation
An observation was conducted on how the PESO was practicing its traditional 
way of creation, recording, and analyzing of files. Job Seekers are also observed on 
how they register to seek jobs in PESO. This observation prompted the researcher to 
strengthen the need to develop a new and an effective way of enhancing the process for 
different users.",Result
"This chapter discuss the analysis and interpretation of the test results as well as 
the observations on the limits of the system capability. The researcher discussed the 
PESO Laguna Integrated Website with Data Mapping for the purpose in ensuring the 
prompt, timely and efficient delivery of employment service of PESO and providing a 
venue where people could explore simultaneously various employment options and 
seek assistance they prefer.",Discussion
