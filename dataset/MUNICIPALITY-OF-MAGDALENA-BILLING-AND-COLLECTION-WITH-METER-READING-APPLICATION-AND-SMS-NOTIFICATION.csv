people due to that number of residents, the Magdalena Waterworks faces many 
problems in terms of organizing the information of all concessionaire, hardly manage 
the billing system since Magdalena Waterworks is still using the manual process by 
using papers.
The Magdalena Waterworks System which is indeed located in a small town is
still into manual process through papers in terms of recording the concessionaire’s 
information, billing and collecting. In that way, the waterworks system has difficulties 
in organizing papers time to time because of the papers that getting old is hardly to 
find and got stack that turns out to be crumpled.
Thus, the researchers come up with a solution that is called Municipality of 
Magdalena Waterworks Billing and Collection with Meter Reading Application and 
SMS Notification. It is a web-based system that organizes the concessionaire’s 
information, the billing and collecting process and a meter reading application for 
meter readers to set the cubic meter then send to the system in order to make a bill and 
for the concessionaire to view the statement of account and payment history.
