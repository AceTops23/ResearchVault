"Today, service organizations have long recognized the importance of 
maintaining good customer satisfaction. Information has now moved to its 
rightful place as a key resource. Customers are always complaining their 
problems and dissatisfaction about the company’s service, with the use of 
Internet and the rise of social media, the way they used to do so has changed. 
While, customers contacted companies through telephone calls or walking in. 
Nowadays, they have the chance to enhance their voices remotely and share 
their dissatisfactions with the organization involved via Short Message Service 
(SMS). Therefore, this study is about enhancing service organizations in the 
customer service department. 
In order to maximize the capability and performance of a customer 
service department, there must be a centralized system that can manage and 
connect the different divisions in the company. The Customer Relationship 
Management System (CRMS) can handle the complaints, reports, repairs, 
suggestions, billing inquiry, risk management and analytics. With the use of the 
CRMS, the concessionaires can get the information they want without 
physically going to the customer service desk. Through Global System for 
Mobile Communications (GSM) technology the system can send, save, receive 
and organize SMS inbox to make the client’s customer service more functional. 
By just texting, the Customer Service Representative can easily provide the 
information that the concessionaire needed. And also, the management will 
know how they can improve their service with the help of the dashboard.The primary goal of CRMS is to integrate and automate customer 
support. The dashboard that gives an overall view of the multiple functions on 
a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard 
provides pending and solved complaints, common complaints, customer 
satisfaction, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the 
customer and the company. With CRM systems customers are served better 
on day to day process and with more reliable information their demand of self 
service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to contact with the 
company for different problems, customer satisfaction level increases.",Introduction
"Santa Cruz Water District (SCWD) is located at A. Mabini Street, Santa 
Cruz Laguna. Since it was established, the SCWD continues to provide water 
services in Sta. Cruz, Laguna. The SCWD has a Public Assistance and 
Complaints Desk (PACD) that manually transact all incoming complaints. Since 
then, the PACD transacts all the complaints since the finance and commercial 
division was established. By using the current manual process, the complaints 
are transacted one at a time and there is a need for the staff to stand up from 
his chair to process the approval in the admin office. After the approval, the staff 
will manually check the inventory for the resources to compute the price of the 
repair. If there is an incomplete resources the complaint will be in pending 
status. Usually the process of complaints takes longer than the expected days
like application and approval for water connection, approval of repairs and 
maintenance, and manual checking of inventory.According to Bezos (2004) “A brand for a company is like a reputation 
for a person. You earn a reputation by trying to do hard things well”. Today, if 
there is something wrong with the service and you cannot fix it by yourself, the 
only thing left is to file a complaint with upper management, with the hope that 
you would receive an apology and an offered solution. Whether it’s a simple 
question of “What date the repairman will fix this leaking water pipe?” or to 
follow up the water reconnection, everyone has at least experienced being told 
to frequently call to inquire about the status of whatever the customer is asking. 
According to the interview by the researchers with the PACD staff, 
Division Manager of Finance and Commercial Department, and Head of the 
Human Resource Department, there is indeed a need to develop a Customer 
Relationship Management System. The researchers developed a fully 
functioning CRMS that gave the PACD, Customer Service Department, and 
Division Manager to have connections to each other in order to process 
complaints faster. And also, the concessionaire has the ability to send their 
complaints, get their bill, and have notifications via SMS.
The long waiting time is consumed in processing of complaints can 
reduce the service satisfaction of the customers and can lessen the growth and
the number of customers. In times of rapidly evolving technologies, customer 
requirements are constantly rising and long-term customer loyalty is hard to 
achieve. The customer service module is used to log, respond, investigate and 
analyze complaints with the idea of maintaining and improving a company’s 
quality of service process.",Method
"Data Collection Methods
Right after the approval of the researcher’s title proposal, the 
researchers headed to Santa Cruz Water District to gather forms and had an 
interview about the manual process of the existing system. They discussed 
about the functions needed and set the expectations about the system.
The researchers requested the approval of the Division Manager of the 
finance and Commercial Department in order to gather the significant 
information necessary to answer the objectives of their study. The researchers 
used instruments and tools like interviews, library research, internet research,
and questionnaires.
• Interviews - In this part the developers will evaluate and analyze the 
client’s problem and translate it to a functioning system in the near future.
The proponents ask questions about the procedures done, problems 
encountered and the requirements needed of the customer service 
division of SCWD.Document review - The articles, magazines, blogs and past studies that 
inspires the idea of the developers are analyzed. The developers also 
analyze the data and process displayed on the website to furthermore 
understand their process.
• Observation - This is the gathering accurate information about how a 
strategy actually operates, particularly about processes. The proponents 
observed not just to the scope but also other divisions involve like the
finance and commercial division.
• Internet Research - The researchers conducted some internet research 
to gain some additional information and to boost their knowledge and 
ideas about the system to be develop.
With this information, they found some designs that can be implement in the 
system and also some additional modules that need to be in the system.
