Door to door interviews have done to gather information on a citizen that will be the participant of the implemented livelihood program and write it on a paper.

From this time forward, people lives in a modernized community where technology is still growing that is why through the interview done by the researchers the idea of having a system for client  is a must in order for them to have a faster and easier work in terms of implementing livelihood programs.
A livelihood is a means of making a living. It encompasses people’s capabilities, assets, income and activities required to secure the necessities of life. A livelihood is sustainable when it enables people to cope with and recover from shocks and stresses (such as natural disasters and economic or social upheavals) and enhance their well-being and that of future generations without undermining the natural environment or resource base. 
Nowadays on a modern economy, to aid the poverty, every municipality provides livelihood programs to reduce and inequality through job creation among poor households and by moving highly vulnerable households into sustainable livelihoods and toward economic stability. 
In order to enhance the current process of the said Municipality, through the observation and interview the researchers developed a study entitled “Sustainable Livelihood Program Management Information System with SMS Notification” that can help the citizen/participants in applying faster and easier in different programs of the Municipality of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.

"Santa Cruz is the capital town of the province of Laguna that is a 1st class municipality. Santa Cruz is the seat of the provincial government since 1885 giving an additional administrative function over the entire province. The town is composed of 26 barangays and 21 are classified as urban barangays. Generally, the town of Santa Cruz is classified as urban municipality. 
 The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) is the executive department of the Philippine government that is responsible for the protection of the social welfare of rights of Filipinos and to promote social development. DSWD is mandated to provide assistance to local government units (LGUs), non-government organizations (NGOs), other national government agencies (NGAs), peoples’ organizations (POs) and other members of civil society in effectively implementing programs, projects, and services that will alleviate poverty and empower disadvantaged individuals, families and communities for an improved quality of life according to the Executive Order 15 s. 1998 as amended by Executive Order 221 (2003).

Also, the office is accepting a request from its citizens about what kind of Sustainable Livelihood Program they prefer to take and when the office identified that there are many requests about the specific project, they will conduct a plan and they will identify what is needed for the project to be implemented.
