"Technology has proven to benefit human experience and achievement in 
many ways and has become a growing aspect of visitor engagement, 
documentation, and research in museums. Today’s businesses are up against 
more challenges than ever in the past. With technology having such a massive 
influence on just about every aspect of modern-day business, organizations in 
just about every industry struggle with how to best approach the workday. One of 
the biggest effects that modern technology has had on business operations 
revolve.
Over the years, paper is still an important information carrier, even in our 
more and more electronically penetrated environment. Every day we use paper 
documents in our office, even when electronic versions of the documents are 
available. Instead of replacing the paper completely as developed by the myth of 
the paperless office, new ways for better integrating paper into our daily work are 
needed. For this reason, new ways are required for the handling of paper 
documents, integrating them to one’s best in our workflow instead of substituting 
them.
Documents come in the form of both paper and electronic. For ages, 
businesses have been following a paper-based document management model. 
However, technology for document processing has been mostly limited to better 
and faster ways to generate, print, and transport text documents. Now severaltrends and developments suggest that we are on the verge of a major advance in 
computer based information management.
Document management focuses on the organization of documents to 
support active work in progress, including content creation and sharing within an 
organization. When organizations do not have any kind of formal document 
management system in place, content is often created and saved in an 
unmanaged and decentralized way on scattered file shares. This process is 
amazingly time consuming and too often ignored.",Introduction
"Managing this ever-growing abundance of documents requires a system 
to ensure that the documents can be track quickly and efficiently. Some 
businesses rely on a manual tracking of their documents to deal with these 
processes.
The Administration Office of Laguna State Polytechnic University is 
currently using their traditional way in handling the documents. They do not have 
any other way in tracking the documents for signing that is outside the office. So 
that, current process cannot prevent/avoid to encounter a problem regarding the 
status of the documents that is for signing. 
All the transaction regarding the incoming and releasing of request letters 
and other paper works were done inside the administration office. There are 
assigned signatories on each type of documents. Since all the signatories are 
required to sign the letter, it is usual for them to encounter a problem regarding 
on this situation. (a) the owners of the document is having a hard time to track 
their documents. They are unaware on which signatory their document is and 
what the status of their documents is. What they do is to keep coming back and 
forth to the office just to ask if their documents are ready to release. (b) the Administration Office is having a problem because they are flooded by many 
follow ups from the owners of the document regarding the status of their 
document. (c) they are encountering a conflict regarding on checking a schedule 
of meetings for some times. Since they do not have any formal way of scheduling 
system, sometimes they are not aware that there were multiple schedule on the 
same date and time. The best solution regarding with the above mentioned
problems is an online document tracking management system with scheduling 
system.
Every business has documents that they must maintain for some reasons. 
With the use of online document tracking management system, every document 
can be track in real time. With this system, it will helps you to save time, less 
hassle in checking the status of the document and to manage documents with 
ease and efficiency. 
So that the proponents came up with the idea of creating e-DOC: LSPU 
Document and Scheduling System with SMS Notification that will help the 
administration office in tracking and organizing all the incoming and releasing of 
letters and other related documents within the office. A system that will answer 
and give solution with the following specific research questions: (1) how to gather 
data pertinent to the stated topic specifically capturing problems encountered by 
the client about the current process of the administration office of the LSPU with 
regards to document tracking; (2) how to design an automated system that would 
address the identified problems and ensure optimal system performance; (3) how to evaluate the software and gather comments and recommendations for further 
improvements of the software.",Method
"The researchers used a deeper analysis on the problems that they 
examined during the research, design and data gathering process, to be able to 
gather information needed in the study. The researchers used several methods 
in collecting data such as researching in library, reading previous thesis and 
surfing through the use of Internet, collecting and comparing related studies and 
literature that somehow similar to study. The researchers conducted an interview 
to be able to gather information about the problems that they were encounter 
during the daily transaction using their current process. To gather primary data or 
data gained from a primary variable, the researchers conducted an informal 
interviews and surveys from the variables given. The following are the fact finding techniques used in order to make the study feasible:
Observation – In able to identify the process and strategies the researchers 
would use, they undergo an observation carefully to gain the information needed 
in the study. 
Interview –The researchers conducted an interview with the Administration 
Office of the Laguna State Polytechnic University. They had a verbal questioning 
with the administrative staffs to gather information and to find out the current 
process of the Administration Office. The researchers demanded all details from 
the user starting from their process, work construction and what is their 
recommended process to enhance.
Internet Research –In gathering data, the internet serves as the most usable 
sources. Browsing in the internet gives the researchers more explanation about 
the study and helps in understanding some information related to the study. 
Some of the literature reviews are gathered through the use of internet.
Library Research – The library serves as the main sources of information for the 
researchers. Library had a lot of thesis, journals and published books that help 
the researchers to have a guideline in making their study.
