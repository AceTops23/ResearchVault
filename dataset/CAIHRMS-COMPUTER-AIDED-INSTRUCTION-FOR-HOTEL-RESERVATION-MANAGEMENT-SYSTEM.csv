"Information Technology has evolved for decades, it has provided the people 
with ease in doing tasks and numerous advantages in this modern world. 
Education has been the great beneficiary of this this technological revolution. 
Graduates are expected to possess skills both on their field and computer 
competencies.
The large growing scale of graduates per academic year in the field of Hotel 
and Management and at the same time, the increasing number of employee in 
restaurants, hotels and other human resource fields of work. For employees with a 
small amount of knowledge and skills in Hotel Reservation Management gives 
them a low possibility of being hired in a prestigious hotels and restaurants due to 
computer technical skills.
The emergent components of computer-aided instruction including 
multimedia presentations and interactive digital books are often developed 
separately to be used as individual approaches in Computer Aided Instruction 
(CAI) without a cohesive and comprehensive strategy. The key to effective CAI in 
the future lies in an integration of these three technologies to form a unified 
approach to education. An integrated approach will give students a comprehensive 
learning about hotel reservation management system that includes in-class, 
independent, and extended learning.
",Introduction
"Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) offers Hotel and Restaurant 
Management and Tourism Programs under the College of Hospitality Management 
and Tourism (CHMT). CHMT professors and instructors are currently using a 
traditional method of teaching and discussing their lessons, and giving quizzes and 
activities. With the use of the recent advances in information technology this can 
provide educators with unique opportunities to fundamentally shape education of 
the future. The new computer technology will help in the revolutionary changes in 
education same as the way we gather and share information.
Developing an effective Computer Aided Instructions specifically training 
courseware is not an easy task. Various elements should be considered such as 
content, structure, learning process and user interface design. The researchers 
has accomplished identifying these elements. The first phase of the study aimed 
to design and develop a training courseware that would help the students of Hotel 
and Restaurant Management (HRM) to provide a real-life training and simulation 
of hotel reservation management system. Specifically, it aimed to (1) identify the 
functional requirements and specifications of the courseware (2) determine the 
appropriate development tools. 
The researchers has accomplished and completed the objectives. 
Identifying the functional requirements of the training courseware as follows: (a) 
user management, scope of lessons, student’s record and simulation of the training 
courseware hotel reservation management system that represent the functional 
requirements of the study (b) the researchers conduct some research literatures 
and studies, interviews to create an idea in the training courseware, and used Addie Model as a software methodology as a development tool lastly the 
researchers found out that the a study’s insights can contribute to the growing body 
of research in areas such as educational learning tool and training software.
This study proceeds to its second phase, the researchers developed 
CAIHRMS – Computer Aided Instruction for Hotel Reservation Management 
System, containing the functional requirements identified from the previous phase 
of the study. At this point, the researchers acknowledged the research general 
problem, how to validate the effectiveness of the developed training courseware 
entitled CAIHRMS, Specifically sought to answer the following research questions: 
(a) how to test the developed training courseware? (b) how to identify the user 
acceptability and behavioral intention using the developed training courseware? (c) 
how to develop an implementation plan? ",Method
"The researchers obtained a deeper analysis on what are the 
problems that they have encountered during the research, designing and 
data gathering process. To be able to gather information needed in the study, 
the following methods were applied;
 The researchers have come up with methods to obtain primary and 
secondary data. For gathering primary data, the researchers have done 
informal interviews with the people who have access when it comes to the 
usage of the laboratory. The researchers have also conducted a survey to know 
the feedback of the users of the current manual process. In this way, the 
researchers will have an insight on where the problem is and what solutions 
they should come up with. For the secondary data, the researchers did a careful library research which provided an average amount of previous studies that will 
guide them with their study. These are reliable sources full of information helpful 
for their research. Another method or tool is online research. There are some 
information not made available in the library, so another option is to search the 
web for reliable sites pertinent to the study. The methods mentioned above are 
ways to obtain secondary data where a primary individual is not needed.
