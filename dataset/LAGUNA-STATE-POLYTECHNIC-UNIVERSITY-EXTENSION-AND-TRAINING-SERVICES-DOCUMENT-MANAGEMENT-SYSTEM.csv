"Through the modernization and advancement of today’s technology, people 
productivity demand new ways in order to conduct their daily routines. People, 
since time immemorial have directed to make life easier. Therefore, the way 
information technology emerged now with the society, it requires adaptation to the 
new knowledge and exciting discoveries. As the technology further innovates, the 
world continue to evolve. Developing itself allowing technological advances to 
people- to carry out the most mundane of humanly effort tasks.
Becoming a vital and integral part of a lot of modern organization, there is 
the information technology that plays an important role bringing a lot implication on 
the daily operations, this what MacKechnie (2017) specified about. In addition, 
internet provides a simple means to communicate. There’s a lot of the 
communication tool that continuously evolved, he added. He also impart the 
importance of data management that documents will be easily and instantly 
available to everyone around the organization, regardless to their location.
Document management or Document management system (DMS) is one 
of the often referred to store, manage and organize electronic documents through 
and with the use of the advancement of technology. DMS has created within the 
past 5 years. It also puts information easily and quickly, solve problems and 
contribute to the organization’s success and advance careers through the 
document management system. The DMS file transfer viewer allows users to see 
at a glance, the progress of all files added or retrieved.
Quezada (2014) clearly stated that one of the process to transfer technology 
moreover, innovation as the paramount objective to improve life of the people is 
through or by doing an extension and training service program. Updating people 
to the current trend in skills and technologies could enable the communities in 
adapting the various long-term trend. She also added that, it identifies as one of 
the multiple functions of a higher education institution. 
In accordance with this, the CMO No.08 Series of 2010 stated that the 
higher education institutions ordered to do an extension and training services with 
the proper instructions, research and production inclined with the vital role and goal 
of the universities in the development of the communities, especially to those who
cannot afford educational fees. Therefore, in building links between the 
communities, extensionists, government extension departments and private 
sectors there’s a need of a community based extension.",Introduction
"Shaping community for sustainable growth and development through 
extension and training service programs is one of the concern of the Laguna State 
Polytechnic University (LSPU), one of the higher institution in the province of 
Laguna that founded on 1952 progressed and become a university with the help 
of the RA 9402. The University has four (4) campuses which located at Santa Cruz, 
the main campus, San Pablo City, Siniloan and Los Baños. In consonance 
mandated to the order of CHED, the university render extension service hand and 
hand with instruction, research and production. Extension and training service 
(ETS) program has been part of the university since the proclamation of the CMO 
No. 08 series of 2010, which is under to research and development department.
The commitment of the university to serve the community by extending its 
service come with the process to ensure its effectiveness for implementation.Therefore, as the chairperson of the ETS in Santa Cruz Campus explain the 
process of how it works, chairperson of each campuses requests each extension 
unit head per college departments to submit topic proposal of what training service 
they want to extent. The university shall be in line with its thrusts and priorities. All 
campuses focuses on these thrusts, (1) Sustainable Development, (2) Gender 
Advocacy Development, (3) Community Development and Good Governance, and 
(4) Environmental Conservation and Management. With this, every college 
extension unit head should aligned their topic proposal with the prescribed thrust 
of their campus. The topic proposal will checked and revised if needed until it is 
ready for the in-house review. After approving the topics, the extensionists will 
present the topic proposal to the in-house review. The purpose of the in-house 
review is to criticize and correct if needed, the proposed service of the 
extensionists.
After the critics, proposal statement would be returned to the proponents 
and should be revised and submit within five (5) working days to the extension 
office. Then, the chairperson will proceed to the BOR and finance committee after 
approval. The implementation of every project will automatically effective next 
school year. With this, the extensionists will know if the extended training service 
was effectual with the clients. Lastly, after the implementation, the submission of 
terminal report. Complying all the needed requirements of the extension service 
that categorized into ten (10) parts. This process focuses on the management and 
transfer of documents from topic proposal to terminal report",Method
"Population of the Study
The study focuses to the extension and training services at the four (4) 
campuses of LSPU. Since the total number of staffs sum up to thirty-six (36), the 
researchers decided not to use sampling method. Hence, all of the respondents 
evaluated and test the system developed by the researchers.
Data Collection Methods
The researchers obtained a deeper analysis on what were the problems 
they encountered during the research, designing and gathering process. To be 
able to gather information needed in the study, the researchers conducted 
following data collection methods.
Observation
Before the researchers developed this study, they first conducted a pre assessment and observation, which they assessed if there’s an improvement 
needed to the current manual process of the client. 
Interview 
The researchers conducted an informal interview consultation, usually to 
evaluate qualifications. The researchers had a personal communication with the 
secretary of ETS-SCC; followed by an interview with the ETS. The purpose of 
preliminary interview was to know more the current process on how the extension 
service management most specifically to the flow their documents the goes- from 
start to the end. While the following interview was conducted for data gathering 
and to get clarifications from the client.
Library Research 
Unpublished materials, written documents, and journals that could found in 
library. Therefore, the researchers conducted a research to the different libraries, 
to gather related studies/literature and software process methodology to find basis 
and guide and has significance and relevance to improve the concept of the study.
Internet Research 
The World-Wide Web is a huge database and a great resource for gaining 
access to information of all kinds. It has been a great help to the researchers for 
searching process for the development of the system and additional knowledge in 
creating codes. In addition, the researchers used the computer to browse the 
Internet to gather data and collecting the foreign studies and literature that serves 
as a basis in order to make the study feasible.
Questionnaires
For the system demonstration and evaluation, the researchers formulated 
questionnaires focused on the quality characteristics under the ISO 9126. The 
researchers went to the different campuses of LSPU to demonstrate and evaluate 
the developed system. They assessed if the developed system meets its 
objectives focusing on its functional requirements. The researchers also gathered 
recommendation and comments for system modification.",Result
"In this section, it presents the system testing and evaluation analysis and 
interpretation of the tests results acquired from the conducted techniques by the 
researchers. It also discussed if the developed system meets its requirements for 
the satisfaction and pursuance of the end-users. 
The researchers formulated the questionnaires along with the system 
quality characteristics from the ISO 9126 that has the quality products to take 
advantage from the system testing and evaluation. The researchers utilized the 
five- point Likert scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, 
Disagree and Strongly Disagree) included on the survey questionnaires and 
utilized as the statistical treatment data of the respondents. The Likert scale was 
a statistical treatment of data that depends on the summated scale type called 
Likert scale type, which utilized to measure the characteristics of the software 
whether it was good or bad. ",Discussion
