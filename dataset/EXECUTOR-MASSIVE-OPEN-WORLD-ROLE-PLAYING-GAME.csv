"As we live in modernized world, every organization have technology to 
lessen the time of work to make it easier for them to finish it. Students in school 
are learning with the help of technology, like watching tutorials and educational 
films that has a moral value that can serve the students knowledge or as
supplementary tool that may be applied in the real world especially in the field 
that they’re learning or sharing with others. The modules that an instructor 
presents through PowerPoint presentation can make the lessons more 
visualizing, interesting, and encouraging for the students to listen to, especially 
if the modules are presented with animation/videos and sound system/effects
that will surely capture the attention of the students. In addition, if the students 
wants a broader information or ideas, there are gadgets that is part of 
technology like smartphones and laptops with wireless connection to connect 
the internet and search what they want to learn and know. There are many 
resources that may help students to finish activities, assignments and tasks in 
time, like using computer laboratories and libraries in schools.",Introduction
"Making the game is trial and error for the researchers because learning
new different softwares for the first time like PaintTool Sai for concept art of the 
game, Maya/Blender/MudBox for modelling and texturing, Unity 6 and C#/Java 
to make the 3 Dimensional model functional. The researchers used the Rapid 
Application Development (RAD) by James Martin that has four Phases;
Requirements Planning, User Design, Construction, and Cutover. We 
researchers use the RAD methodology because it is more focus on 
development than planning and it’s applicable in game development. The main
objective of the researchers is how to develop and design a computer role playing game entitled “.Executor: Massive Open World Role-Playing Game 
(RPG)” that will serve as a supplementary tool in familiarizing basic C# 
Programming Language especially for College of Computer Studies in Laguna 
State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus and also to serve them 
entertainment by the game’s audiovisual effects by interacting the game?. On 
the first phase of the study, the problems that the researchers must answer to 
achieve their goal are: (a) how to develop a computer role playing game that can be incorporated with audiovisual aid like animation/graphics and 
music/sound FX that will hook the attention of the user? (b) how to develop a 
computer role-playing game that will improve student’s analytical skills by 
playing the role playing game’s every level/chapter (c) how to develop a role 
playing game that will entertain the College of Computer Studies in Laguna 
State Polytechnic University SCC? The study is on the second phase which 
aimed to test the acceptability and the functional requirements of the developed 
role playing game entitled “.Executor: Massive Open World Role-Playing 
Game”. The researchers sought to answer the following questions: (a) how to 
evaluate the game functional requirement as perceive by the Gamer and non gamer from BSIT and (BSCS)? (b) to assess the difference of significance 
between the gamer and non-game Bachelor of Science in Information 
Technology BSIT and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science students 
(BSCS) (c) how to evaluate the acceptability and behavioral intention of the
Gamer and non-gamer researchers to the BSIT and BSCS students in playing 
and interacting the developed game.",Method
"The researchers use the following methods to gather important
information that will help them in making the capstone project entitled “Executor 
Massive Open World Role-Playing Game”.",Result
"In the tests that has been conducted by the researchers, they found out 
that testing a game needs a very precise checking the acceptability and the 
functional requirements that is very significant to the study and to the 
respondents that will test the game because when testing the game you really 
need to be focus on the objectives of the study where you are going to base if 
you provided all the elements that is needed on the study that you developed. 
When checking the game’s controls the keys/modules should work accordingly 
to its function that the researcher set if any debug or error encountered in the 
testing, the researchers will fix and improve as soon as possible. The 
Implementation and the introduction of the game is held on the 22nd of March. 
The testing of the game that is served for the student of College of Computer 
Studies from Laguna State Polytechnic University as respondents to 
experience and to evaluate the study that has been developed. The 
respondents from 2 sections from Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology are very cooperative and 
listens very well on the discussion about the game. Most of the students who 
evaluated the game are entertained and impressed though some of the 
students comment/s are negative, we researches obeyed it because it is also 
the reason if the study that has been developed if it’s acceptable and effective 
for the users.",Discussion
