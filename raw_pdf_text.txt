 ABSTRACT  
The main objective of this study is to develop and assess the User Acceptance 
Testing on an Online Loaning Management System that assist the Cooperatives and 
loaners in their daily transactions like recording of new loaner and monitoring their 
loan status. The following matters are considered: (1) To design and develop a system 
that contains an Integrated online and offline loaning management system; (2) To test 
the functionalities of the developed Loaning Management System based on the 
behavior of the system during the testing phase  focusing on its features;(3) To evaluate 
the level of acceptability using the developed system.  The descriptive and 
developmental research design is applicable in this study in which it will be useful to 
accurately and systematically describe a population , situation or phenomenon and can 
use both qualitative and quantitative research methods (Macombes,2019). Moreover, 
developmental research is often associated with participatory action research, 
combining research and practice in such a way that the study brings about some 
situational improvement and research increases the broader understanding of the issue 
(Hasan,2003).  This study utilized purposive sampling method. Samples was taken 
through selected respondents directly from the District 4 in Laguna Coop eratives 
participated. Various instrument was used in gathering data such as face -to-face 
interview with the general managers, survey, online research, library research and on -
site observation. The researcher used Weighted Mean and the Standard Deviation.  The 
result of the study shows that the “Integration of Cooperative under PCDO Loaning 
Management System” resolved the problem of the cooperative concerning the manual 
process of loaning management.

CHAPTER I  
INTRODUCTION  
 A cooperative is a very know organization everywhere in the Philippines as a 
place where do people ran and borrow money in a small interest in payment as for the 
reason of the lack of finance. Cooperative organizations basically work to provide 
assistance and help in terms of money, agricultural tools, and etc. The  main purpose of 
any cooperative organization is to provide service to its active members.  
 Among of all of cooperatives there are only few who uses technology as a 
practice of their works but mostly estimated of 70 -90 percent of the cooperatives in the 
Laguna or Philippines uses manually or old school method of recording, retrieving, and 
searching of the past and present records about their cooperative, in which there was a 
big disadvantage of using it, as compared of using of an online system which is 
processed and generated by the computer itself with only the command of each users of 
the system who are the Cooperatives Admins even the members itself . 
 The ‘Integration of the Cooperatives Loaning Management System” aims to help 
PCDO, Cooperative, and the loaners.  The system would organize schedule of PCDO 
and Cooperative to lessen the time of scheduling the seminars to immediately response 
to its reques t and to provide solution to the problem of the cooperative. The system also 
would manage and organize the records of all other cooperative and to store in one 
database. And the system would allow the loaners monitors their account from the 
cooperative to be open in the browsers. The study would focus on the credit cooperative 
in the district 4 . And the system would allow the loaners monitors their account from 
the cooperative to be open in the browsers.

Project Context  
The Provincial Cooperative Development Office (PCDO), Located at Sta 
Cruz, Laguna which aimed to help, improve, and develop different Cooperatives 
(Credit, Consumers, Producers, Agrarian Reform, Service, Agriculture, and 
Multipurpose Cooperatives) at the p rovince of Laguna, they conducted Seminars 
every once a month to be participated by the officers of the Cooperatives especially 
the Head Manager to teach all the cooperatives in Laguna to be a good and well -
structured cooperative that would lend a money to  all the qualified citizens who 
barrow’s money to them. The purpose of the PCDO conference that they’ve done is 
to avoid the bigger problems of the cooperatives that will possibly happen. The 
PCDO’s geographical position has been a variable of the differen t cooperatives here 
in Laguna, which resulted the large number of its members, 410 Cooperatives is the 
total population registered in PCDO which included the different types of 
Multipurpose Cooperatives.   
The “Republic act 3765: Truth in Lending Act” whic h stated that the 
Cooperative must follow of implementing a 1% of interest to any amount of loan 
that the loaners borrow. And it must be a diminishing of 1% interest which means 
that the interest must vary to the remaining balance of the loaner.  
Based on our observation, many files and documents from the current and 
past data were scattered throughout the office and the cabinets, so it took time to find 
some documents if someone is needed to have it. In paying loans, the main problem 
is the updating the st atus of the loaner. In our interview with the secretary, a person 
is already paid their loan but, the ledger that the collectors had must be updated to 
the office, but they didn’t do it immediately resulting to have a misunderstanding to 
the cooperative of fice and the loaner. In the office record, the person didn’t pay on 3 
 
the month or week they must pay the fact that he/she pay it accordingly.  They don’t 
have a software that would help them in keeping the records safely and updating the 
ledger and the book easily, for the way of their updating the record that they are in 
manual process, on the main records that they have.   
There are different problems that the PCDO and Credit Cooperatives 
encountered in the processes in operating their services. 1.) The PCD O takes a long 
time in replying to the request of seminars each cooperative for the PCDO still need 
to match their own schedule with the cooperatives. 2.) Cooperatives management of 
records is not in good situation that causes loss of records, and took a l ong period of 
time of searching of the past records. 3) The lack of management of records causes 
an effect to the cooperative’s members and it causes a double payment for not 
updating the book even if the loaner had already paid. 4.) The cooperative can’t view 
the previous record of the its new members and to check if the loaners have no debt 
at other cooperative.  
The researchers  formulated questions that are needed to answer : 1.) How to 
achieve a common process for all other cooperatives based on the comm on problem 
that was discovered during gathering processes. 2.) How to determine the current 
effect of the proposed new web system process from their own manual loaning 
management system and spreading for announcements for seminars. 3.) How to 
design an onl ine and offline automated loaning management system that can be used 
by any of credit cooperatives. 4.) How to design a system for Integrating all 
cooperatives online for easy sharing of thoughts and ideas for Cooperative 
management. 5.) How to gather and evaluate for response of the PCDO, 
Cooperatives, and its loaners of the experience after using the website system being 
developed.  4 
 
Research Objectives  
The study aims to develop and assess the User Acceptance Testing on an Online 
Loaning Management System that assist the Cooperatives and loaners in their daily . 
The study generally aims to provide integrated system as a solution from problems 
gathered from different Cooperatives that will enhance their current loaning 
management system.   
Specifically, the study aims to:  
1.) to design and develop a system that contains an Integrated online and offline 
loaning  management system that can be used by Credit Cooperatives 
registered in PCDO.  
2.) to test the functionalities of the developed Loaning Management System 
based on the behavior of the system during the testing phase focusing on its 
features:  
a.) User Management.  
b.) Data Management.  
c.) Loans Profile and Status.  
d.) Loaner’s Personal Accounts  
3.) to evaluate the level of acceptability using the developed system in term of:  
a.) Quality Factors.  
b.) Perceive ease of use  
c.) Perceive usefulness  
d.) Attitude towards using  
e.) Behavioral intention to use 
f.) Experience  5 
 
Conceptual Framework  
  This section presents the research framework of the study, this is to fully describe 
the purpose of the project that the researchers present, the figure below shows the 
proposed title. The researchers undergo planning of the development of the study 
includ ing on how to gathered data through face-to-face interview, library research, 
consultation from IT experts and with the advice of researcher advise to gathered 
precise and significant data for the formation and the development of the system.  In 
execution o f the planning,  it includes the interview of the population with the PCDO, 
Cooperatives, and its loaners.  The researches analyze the gathered data to formulate the 
design of the system in preparation of the development. after the development of the 
system,  it undergoes black box testing with the IT experts and User Acceptability of the 
system with ISO standards and Likert Scaling  answered by PCDO, Cooperatives 
general managers and secretaries and loaners form different cooperatives .

Project Purpose  
The Integration of Cooperatives under PCDO loaning management system is a 
system that help the PCDO, Credit Cooperatives, and its members or loaners.  
Credit Cooperatives - it would be a great help to the cooperatives because the 
system almost focuses to them, as for they are the respondents of the researchers, the 
system would help  the cooperatives in handling the records that they have, and the 
system would do the processes and operation that the cooperative is doing with the 
operators (Director, General Manager, Secretary, and Auditor).  
Loaners - the loaners would be part of the r esearch for they would have a role in 
the system as a they can visit their account and can view their records (amount and date 
of the next payment and the records of payments that they paid before up to now).  
All Cooperatives - this system would be a great help to all other cooperatives for 
this would be a way that they will be connected in a one online server or domain. They 
can share their thoughts and ideas of how to deal with different cooperative problems 
that they will be facing throughout the time. There would be a less time for all 
cooperatives to communicate in everyplace and meeting for they can talk and 
communicate online.  
Future Researchers - this study would be a great help to future researchers for 
they can use this study a source of information that relates to their study.  
This system would be serving them in all time and every work that they will do 
to lessen efforts and time in working and dealing with the problems of their current and 
present pro cess instead they can user more of their time focusing of the problem of each 
loaner.

Scope and Limitation of the Study  
The study determine d the problem from PCDO to credit cooperative. The aspect will 
be looked into which are the most specific and common problem that a loaner and the 
cooperative encounter.  
● This study focuses  on PCDO on how they interact and communicate with 
different coopera tives here in Laguna.  
● All of the data that are gathered show a record to easily find the most common 
problem of the cooperatives in a specific place in District 4.  
● The study was conduct ed to the credit cooperative only in the district 4 to easily 
integrat e all the cooperatives.  
● The study  was done through the utilization of face -to-face interview to the 
chairpersons of each cooperatives to better understand the loaning system on 
each cooperative.  
● The study ask ed questions to the members as part of the data gathering of the 
study to know the problems encountered by the loaners in the services and 
process of the cooperatives.  
● The population of this study were  the members of the cooperatives specifically 
the loaners  inside in a cooperative.  
However, the study has its own limitations:  
• The data gathered from the cooperatives and PCDO would remain confidential 
and would not be shared to anyone.  
• The researchers of the study would not forcefully ask confidential data or  ask 
any records that would violates any cooperative policies.  
• The study would not mention or used any names that are members of the 
cooperative to be used as a sample.  8

Cooperatives District 4 Loaning Management System’. The literature of this study came 
from different studies uploaded onl ine in the file of PDF or E -books, foreign and local 
that are believed to be useful in the advancement of awareness concerning the study.    
E-Government   
In Manoharan (2018) article entitled “Conceptualizing E -Government from 
Local Government Perspective s” he/she explained that over the past decades, 
government and public  sector organizations have been used information and 
communication technologies to integrate or upgrade their service through various type 
like in information, transaction, participation to enhance the delivery of services.   
 E- Government refers to gover nment organizations' use of Internet and other 
information technologies to avail their information and services to the public  according 
to Al-Jamal & Abu -Shanab  (2016 ) in their research entitled  “The influence of open 
government on e -government website: t he case of Jordan” . 
Making it more efficient  to the cooperatives in district 4  in the way that all 
process and system of their services will be faster than before benefiting not just to their 
people but also to the public servants also who are struggling i n processing the data 
needed  and to ensure that the system would not be compromise in terms of services they 
are offering .     9 
 
However, in Mensah (2019) study entitled “Factors Influencing the Intention of 
University Students to Adopt and Use E -Government Services: An Empirical Evidence 
in China”,  he/she  suggest that employees offering new solution or directives on 
technological tools have negative impact due to the challenging nature of the 
technology and changing attitudes of people who use these kinds of  technology 
application.  
E-government adoption studies continue to be an argument due to faster 
changing in technology but in contrast, this kind of application has the potential to 
accelerate human development needs such as culture, social, economic, and  political 
development. It has also transformed cultures, societies, and economies and eradicated 
poverty according to United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 
[UNDESA] (2016) article entitled “2016 UN E -Government Survey”.     
E-government  research in developing countries is relevant because of the need 
to increase the effectiveness of public administration. An important issue is the 
elimination of bureaucratic procedures to improve access to information and the need 
to evaluate e -governmen t implementation using modern methods, Choi (2016). 
Important for these countries is the perception of e -government by citizens and civil 
servants the efficiency of E -services provision and the enhancement of the role of 
information technology in the fight  against corruption, Pauhofova (2018)  
But according to Urbina (2017) in his/her research entitled “Citizen -centric 
Perspective on the Adoption of E -Government in the Philippines”, the absence of 
sufficient awareness to the citizens has becoming short sight ed about the benefits of e -
government which will have negative effects on their intention to use these services. 
Findings among the Philippines showed that 35% of the people surveyed indicate that 
they were aware of e -government websites, whereas 65% had i ndicate that they are 10 
 
unaware. In order for the citizen to support this technology, government and 
organizations must provide an adequate information for their citizen to support it. Thus, 
it will help mobilize the technology more efficiently because the c itizen or member of 
an organization will be able to use it properly.   
In contrast according to Abadi & Supatno (2018)  in their research  entitled 
“Improving Services to Communities in Pringsewu District Goverment with E -
Government Concept”, they conclude t hat many problems are still being faced to better 
empower this technology. The hardest problem is resistance to change, where certain 
parties in the government and private organizations still maintain an old culture that 
tends to be inflexible. This proble m must be overcome so that the concept of e -
government can be applied and empowered to provide the best service to the wider 
community. the significance of the applying the E government is important in the 
Philippines to have a better and faster services b e offered to the Filipino citizen across 
the country.   
Nevertheless, according to Jin Sangki (2018)  in his/her research entitled “Vision 
of future e -government via new e -government maturity model: Based on Korea's e -
government practices ” explores  the importance of maturity of e -government systems 
and future prospects of e -government development. The author argues that the change 
in the social paradigm caused by new information technologies has offered a new model 
of e-government development. This model includes two aspects, such as the level of 
social maturity based on e -democracy and the level of maturity of civil society. Authors 
have studied the use of innovative technologies in e -government, cloud infrastructure, 
e-governance in the social cont ext. 
Enabling ICT in good governance can also have a huge and positive impact on 
how governing bodies in an organization can reduce its corruption inside. In a study of 11 
 
Sabani (2019)  in his/her research  entitled “Indonesia in the Spotlight: Combating 
Corru ption through ICT enabled Governance”, concluded that ICT enabled needs to be 
in place to support the eradication of corruption in Indonesia, which is one of the most 
widespread problem not just in Indonesia but also in other countries.    
Therefore, enabl ing ICT not just in a government but also on different private 
organizations helps to systematically reduce the corruption which will gain more trust 
on their people inside. Helping also to have a sustainable and proper system in which 
all people in an org anization will benefit.    
ICT has become a tool of great importance in today’s business in all spheres of 
life globally. From commerce to aeronautics, medicine to education, the daily use of 
ICT is vital to the success of the business. In the area of high er education management, 
ICT use is of central significance as universities of the contemporary world cannot 
afford to ignore the role of that ICT plays in the running of their institutions as a 
business and, as such, need to ensure they are not left behin d by the developments. 
Therefore, as a matter of necessity, the universities are required to embrace ICT 
adoption in teaching/learning and administrative activities  according to Edoru (2018)  
in his/her research entitled “ Information and communication techn ology and 
educational services management at a Ugandan university ”. 
Cooperative   
A cooperative business, also known as co -op, is a type of organization own by 
its members, who is also happen to use the services and products of the cooperative. It 
is different from other companies, because they are formed and operate for the benefit 
of their members according to LaMarco (2018) in his/her article entitle d “The 
Advantages of a Cooperative Business”.     12 
 
Also, according to Nipun (2017) in his/her journal entitled “Cooperative Form 
of Business” cooperative helps mainly low -income family to i mproved their financial 
position. The members of cooperatives also combined together on a basis of equality in 
achieving some economic objectives. And lastly the most important objective of a 
cooperative is to further the economic interest of the members.    
Mozas and Puentes (2018) on their research entitled “Cooperative Dynamics 
During the Financial Crisis: Evidence from  Basque and Breton Case Studies” indicate 
the key characteristics of cooperatives (democratic control, equity, equal voting rights, 
profi t-sharing, social responsiveness, job security, and social inclusion) that make the 
transition toward a more responsible model easier. Cooperatives provide access to 
social services, give economic opportunities to their members, create employment, 
empower the disadvantaged to defend their interests, do not discriminate, and over 
support and access to economic resources. All of the above are related to Sustainability 
Development Goals 1 (reduction of poverty) and SDG 10(reduced inequalities).  
There are many  advantages and disadvantages of having and joining to a 
cooperative, according to Sinha (2015)  in his/her  article entitled “Advantages and 
Disadvantages of Cooperative Society – Discussed!” enumerated and discussed what 
are common advantages of cooperativ e, one is that it is easy to form because compared 
to the formation of a company, formation of a cooperative society is easy. Any ten adult 
persons can voluntarily form themselves into an association and get it registered with 
the Registrar of Co -operative s. Formation of a cooperative society also does not involve 
long and complicated legal formalities. And another is tax advantage, why? Because  
Unlike other three forms of business ownership, a co -operative society is 
exempted from income -tax and surcharge  on its earnings up to a certain limit. Besides, 
it is also exempted from stamp duty and registration fee.    13 
 
In support to this, according to Kadu (2015)  in his/her  article entitled “4 Main 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Cooperative Organization”, A coop erative 
organization is owned and controlled by members, it has a democratic control: one 
member, one vote, and profit distribution (surplus earnings) to members is carried on 
in proportion to the use of service; surplus may be allocated in shares or cash.   
Benos (2016)  in his/her  study entitled “Cooperatives' organizational 
restructuring, strategic attributes, and performance: the case of agribusiness 
cooperatives in Greece”, consider that cooperatives generally meet sustainability 
insofar as a community o f people voluntarily united, having an organizational design 
based on democracy and collaboration to develop economically in an equitable way and 
guarantee the social well -being of the cooperative members and the community.  
According to ICA (2016) study en titled “Co -operatives and Sustainability: an 
investigation into the relationship”, the United Nations has emphasized that 
cooperatives are sources of sustainable development, and this importance can be widely 
noticed in countries with less developed econom ies and, mainly, in the agricultural 
sectors. Cooperatives in general adopt the sustainability regulatory framework based on 
GRI, AA1000, ISO standards. It could be observed that requirements for sustainability 
are clearly defined, but measures for assessi ng it deserves to be considered accordingly 
to their application based on Marcis et al., (2018) on their research entitled 
“Sustainability performance evaluation of agricultural cooperatives’ operations: a 
systemic review of the literature”.  
 
In contrast, cooperatives also have its own disadvantages. According on  Murphy 
(2015)  on his/her  article entitled “Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cooperative ”, 
Enumerates some disadvantages of cooperatives like number one, Obtaining Capital 14 
 
through Investors, because cooperatives may suffer from slower cash flow since a 
member’s incentive to contribute depends on how much they use the cooperative’s 
services an d products. While the “one member -one vote” philosophy is appealing to 
small investors, larger investors may choose to invest their money elsewhere because a 
larger share investment in the cooperative does not translate to greater decision -making 
power. An other is lack of membership and participation. If members do not fully 
participate and perform their duties, whether it be voting or carrying out daily 
operations, then the business cannot operate at full capacity. If a lack of participation 
becomes an ong oing issue for a cooperative, it could risk losing members.   
Sometimes cooperative businesses show an unwillingness to pay the kind of 
salary needed to attract and hold competent managers and other employees. In 
consequence managers and good workers are o ften drawn to higher -paid jobs in 
commercial businesses. Another weakness of cooperation is that the mass of members 
may lose interest in running the organization and let a small group take it over and 
manage it for their own benefit   
Cooperative plays an  important role in our society. In a study of Mhembwe & 
Dube  (2017) in their research entitled “The role of cooperatives in sustaining the 
livelihoods of rural communities: The case of rural cooperatives in Shurugwi District, 
Zimbabwe”, conclude that coope ratives play a significant role in defining and 
sustaining the lives of the communities. Therefore, rural communities have a lot to 
benefit from undertaking cooperative programs. Rural communities that continue to 
exist without cooperatives are likely to f ind themselves entangled in high levels of 
poverty. Their study concluded that cooperatives are established for various purposes, 
including economic development, empowering of marginalized members of 
communities, to address market failures, as a defense ag ainst adverse socio -economic 15 
 
conditions, to access cheap transport and storage facilities and to purchase inputs at 
affordable prices.   
In an article of borgenproject.org (2018) entitled “7 Reasons why cooperatives 
are important to poverty reduction”, sta tes that cooperatives are important in reducing 
poverty. All cooperatives, social or economic, are mechanisms that ensure the growth 
and prosperity of communities. In developing and transitioning countries that lack 
access to capital, education, and traini ng, cooperative structures allow communities to 
pool together their resources to solve problems, identify common goals and target the 
causes and symptoms of poverty.   
 And also, in a study of Alamsya (2018) entitled “The Influence of Web Based 
Cooperative  Information System to Improve the Quality of Member Service in 
Universitas Muhammadiyah Sukabumi”, states that the role of cooperative is still very 
important in Indonesia and technology development compels cooperative to change in 
management especially i n presenting data that is more accurate, complete, fast, and 
transparent.  
 López and Marcuello (2016)  in their  study entitled  “Agricultural Cooperatives 
and Economic Efficiency” found that a decrease in efficiency among cooperatives in the 
Philippines due  to the management of cooperative management is still done well in 
traditional sales activities as well as in the capital and asset management. While Ludena 
(2019)  in his/her  study entitled “Agricultural Productivity Growth, Efficiency Change 
and Technical  Progress in Latin America and the Caribbean”, states that the level of 
efficiency of cooperatives in Latin America and the Caribbean is much better because it 
is supported by the positive contribution of the agricultural sector to economic growth 
in the c ountry.  16 
 
 And also, according to Perotin (2016)  in his/her  study entitled “What do we 
really know about worker co -operatives?”, Co -operatives have been shown to be more 
productive than conventional businesses, often due to workers being more engaged with 
their organization, with stronger levels of trust and more effective knowledge sharing. 
Co-operative start -ups are almost twice as likely to survive their first five years when 
compared to traditional companies. (Co -operatives UK 2018) and have been shown to 
have lower levels of staff turnover, lower pay inequalit y, and lower absenteeism rates 
compared with other businesses. (Mayo 2016)  
Loaning    
Credit is something that you borrow money/capital or goods and services with 
an understanding that you will pay later. Cooperatives nowadays have offering this 
service in  which they will lend money to the loaner and pay it with an interest. Loaning 
can help you pay for the things you need when you don’t have enough cash, but 
borrowing money can be can be complicated. For example, starting the bank loan 
application process without knowing or understanding the ins and outs can cause your 
loan request to be rejected according to Pritchard (2020)  in his/her  article entitled “How 
to Get a Bank Loan”.     
Borrowing money from a financial institution like cooperative has the benef it of 
obtaining necessary cash quickly, but you also need to consider the downsides of 
interest payments and legal issues if you fail to pay back the loan. One example is failure 
to pay your loan that can result in a lawsuit being filed against you. This c an result in 
wage garnishment and a negative mark on your record. This is one of the worst possible 
outcomes, but it's why all borrowers must remain wary and conservative when taking 
out a loan from a financial institution as stated by Montoya (2019)  in hi s/her  study 
entitled “Pros & Cons of Borrowing Money from a Financial Institution”.     17 
 
According on Upcounsel (2020)  in his/her  journal entitled “Advantages and 
Disadvantages of Loan Capital”, another thing that consider one of the disadvantages 
of having  a loan is that they have higher interest rate. Why, because they are unsecured 
and have less strict qualification criteria, lenders consider them riskier. This means they 
charge higher rates to compensate for that because you get money fast and pay it off  
quicker.   
Is also plays an important role to our community like in Sathish (2017)  in his/her  
study entitled “a study on loan portfolio management of urban cooperative banks in 
tamil nadu”, shows that Cooperative Banking System has two broad systems i.e. urban 
and rural cooperatives, forms an integral part of the India’s Financial System. Urban 
Cooperative Banks play an important role as financial intermediaries in catering to the 
credit requirements of both priority sector and weaker section of the commun ities.  
Further, the interventions should include targeted financial literacy programs 
with aspects of technological education among clients in the higher age brackets, as 
well as clients with low education status who reported low adoption, according Njogu  
(2017)  in his/her  research entitled “Influence of Technology Adoption on Credit Access 
among Small Holder Farmers: A Double -Hurdle Analysis, Africa International Journal 
of Management Education and Governance”.  
Importance of technology in a Cooperative  
Shakya (2019) in his/her  research entitled “Role of business intelligence and 
information technology in developing countries developing countries, Iowa State 
University Capstones, Theses and Dissertations” said that information technology has 
been recognized  as one of the most important factors separating the developing and 
developed countries. And many organizations like Cooperative all over the world utilize 
the advantage of having a technology inside on a cooperative. Just like on Ramdhani 18 
 
(2018)  in his/he r study entitled “Design and building a cooperative administrative 
information system”, states that creating system to the Cooperative Employee Republic 
of Indonesia (KPRI) Kokardan Majalengka regency expected to improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of  cooperative work.  
In support, Andreansyah (2020)  in his/her  study entitled “Implementation of 
Incremental Models on Development of Web -Based Loan Cooperative Applications” 
shows that employee process so far, it still uses the manual method, start from recording 
attendance, up to the salary calculation process and developed Web -based application 
development by researchers to overcome the problems of XYZ Savings and Credit 
Cooperatives.  
Arisandy (2019)  in his/her  research entitled “Savings and Loan Applications 
Using Web Based User Centered Design” aims to facilitat e savings and loan transactions 
with effective and efficient, from the user side, the user can find out the data member in 
the form of total deposits and loans with easy access. After doing research Cooperative 
gem Bakti Nusantara, savings and loan process  often experience delays due to reports 
that the old data collection and input process is slow. Which was made based saving web 
application to overcome the problems of savings and loan owned, it is expected that 
these applications and the cooperative membe rs can easily find out information about 
savings and loans, and as well as to increase the number of new members.  
Other than that, one type of cooperative is a savings and loan cooperative, and 
many cooperatives perform conventional data processing. It can cause problems like old 
search data, inaccurate borrowing and inaccurate reports. Therefore, the need for 
applica tion programs that are applied, by creating a design program that is able to 
provide information in the process of storing information produced quickly, timely and 
accurate, based on Hidayati (2018)  in his/her  research entitled “Penggunaan Rapid 19 
 
Applicatio n Development dalam Rancang Bangun Program Simpan Pinjam pada 
Koperasi”.   
In contrast, the study of Rachman  (2020)  in his/her  entitled “The influence of 
information technology and organizational culture on the quality of management 
accounting information systems”, shows transmission in the activity of sending data 
from one location to another via a computer network in Bandung city government 
cooperatives is good, but not perfect this is caused by connectivity problems between  
divisions  may  be  caused  b y  weak  connectivity,  technical  disturbances  such  as  
exposed  to malware, the internet network is weak and so on.  
But according to Kurniawati (2018)  in his/her  research entitled “User center 
design (ucd) to design and build information systems for s aving loan data processing in 
cooperatives” shows that the use of technology in support of corporate or organizational 
activities is currently growing, one of which is in the operational data processing 
company or organization. Technology that is currently  widely used for data processing 
is a computerized system, with a computerized data processing system, can be done 
quickly and accurately and based on Patiño (2015)  in his/her  study entitled “Technology 
Trends for Business Productivity Increase” shows that  some of the technology trends 
that companies can use in  their business processes which increase productivity and 
improve the competitiveness of the sectors .  
Relatively, Santoso (2018)  in his/her  study entitled “The Effect of Service 
Quality, Utilization of Information Technology, and Innovation on Marketing 
Performance of Savings and Loan Cooperative Putra Mandiri Surabaya” shows that 
Putra Mandiri Surabaya Savings and Loans Cooperative should always develop new 
innovations in the field of service and coo perative products offered to its members / 
customers, so that in the future members / customers of the Mandiri SurabayaSavings 20 
 
and Loan Cooperative will have a wide choice of products and services can be used by 
every member / customer. It completely shows  that the needs of technology to improve 
their services is very crucial to this day that people need.  
According to Njogu (2017)  in his/her  study entitled “Influence of Technology 
Adoption on Credit Access among Small Holder Farmers: A Double -Hurdle Analys is”, 
using data from dairy farmers, the study explored the relationship between an 
individual’s espousal of mobile banking technology and the likelihood to access a 
commercial bank loan through the mobile -banking platform. Specific social -
demographic facto rs were hypothesized to moderate the relationship between mobile -
banking technology adoption and credit access. The study was anchored on the fact that 
the world is swiftly transiting from an industrial to a knowledge -based technological 
environment for su stainable development.  
So why should cooperatively improve their services? Based on Moyi (2019) in 
his/her  study entitled “Loan growth and risk: evidence from microfinance institutions 
in Africa. Business Department” shows that Microfinance markets in Sub -Saharan 
Africa (SSA) have experienced remarkable growth, particularly after the early 2000s. 
Since microfinance institutions (MFIs) provide financial services such as loans, savings 
and insurance to poor clients who face exclusion from formal financial ins titutions, they 
are considered as one of the most prolific tools to alleviate poverty and achieve financial 
inclusion in developing countries. Through this, cooperatives should also improve their 
services thru the use of technology while the they grow as a  whole.  
Likewise, in the study of Alamsy (2018)  in his/her  entitled “The Influence of 
Web Based Cooperative Information System to Improve the Quality of Member Service 
in Universitas Muhammadiyah Sukabumi”, shows that the result of service quality 
toward member is fast in providing more accurate data with the availability of 21 
 
cooperative information system so that data which is wanted can be obtained faster, 
accurate, and can decrease mistake in writing data process and decrease mistake in 
presenting financ e report. So instead of processing manually the major advantage of 
having a technology is to improve the services which the cooperative offers.  
According to Njogu (2017)  in his/her  study entitled “Influence of Technology 
Adoption on Credit Access among Sm all Holder Farmers: A Double -Hurdle Analysis”, 
was anchored on the fact that the world is swiftly transiting from an industrial to a 
knowledge -based technological environment for sustainable development.  
It pointed out that the need of improvement through  the use of technology will 
greatly improve significantly making it more sustainable to the cooperative as well as 
to the members.  
 
Privacy   
The rise in Internet of Things (IoT) have further exacerbated security and 
information privacy challenges. One mai n reason is organizations and individuals 
constantly violate regulations and rules. While cybersecurity and privacy scholars 
accentuate on the likelihood of rule violations at the individual and organizational levels, 
the evidence for and discussion of thi s concept is still scant, based on Dorasamy (2017) 
research entitled “ Cyber Security Violation in I0T -Enabled Bright Society: A Proposed 
Framework, AIS Electronic Library (AISeL) ”. 
According to Canedo (2020) study entitled “Perceptions of ICT practitioners  
regarding software privacy”, during software development activities, it is important for 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practitioners to know and 
understand practices and guidelines regarding information privacy, as software 22 
 
requirements m ust comply with data privacy laws and members of development teams 
should know current legislation related to the protection of personal data.  
It is important to note that “privacy management is not just a matter for the 
exercise of individual actions but  also an important aspect of institutional structure 
through industry and organizational practices” according to Xu, Dinev, Smith, & Hart, 
(2017)  in their journal entitled “ Information Privacy and Correlates: An Empirical 
Attempt to Bridge and Distinguish Privacy -Related Concepts. European Journal of 
Information Systems ”. 
Because big data is a part of our daily reality; consumers are constantly making 
decisions that reflect their personal preferences, resulting in valuable personal data. 
Facial recognition and other emerging technologies have raised privacy concerns due 
to the increased efficiency and scope which businesses and governments can use 
consumer data according to McGruer (2020)  in his/her  study entitled “Emerging 
Privacy Legislation in  the International Landscape: Strategy and Analysis for 
Compliance”.  
Perceptions of privacy control and risks not only increase users' privacy 
concerns, but can potentially create a situation where users distrust organizations and 
hesitate to disclose pers onal information according to Libaque -Saenz, Chang, Kim, 
Park, & Rho, (2016)  in their research entitled “ The Role of Perceived Information 
Practices on Consumers’ Intention to Authorise Secondary Use of Personal Data. 
Behaviour and Information Technology ”. Hence, it is important that organizations are 
capable of building trust and encouraging users to share personal information. To do 
that, organizations need to understand how users conceive the privacy assurance 
mechanisms provided and how these mechanisms  are linked to factors that affect users' 
decisions to disclose personal information (Chang, Wong, Libaque -Saenz, & Lee, 23 
 
2018), such as perceptions of privacy control and risks, privacy concerns, trusting belief 
and behavior related to personal information  disclosure. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of how organizational privacy assurances can be related to users' privacy 
concerns, perceptions, and trust and information disclosure behavior would help 
organizations to develop effective privacy pract ices and management strategy.  
Chang et al. (2018) in their studies, when users feel they are in control of their 
information, they tend to have a higher level of trust toward the disclosure of personal 
information to organizations, also found that the lac k of perceived control reduces 
customers' trust toward an organization.  
According to Harris (2016)  in his/her  study entitled “Privacy on the go”, issued 
recommendations for mobile application developers and the mobile industry to 
safeguard consumer privac y. This work provided guidance on developing strong 
privacy practices, translating these practices into mobile -friendly policies, and 
coordinating with mobile industry actors to promote comprehensive transparence.   
Research Design   
Qualitative and descriptive research methods have been very common 
procedures for conducting research in many disciplines, including education, 
psychology, and social sciences. This concerned more with what rather than how or 
why something happens. Thus, observation and s urvey tools are commonly used in 
collecting and gathering all the data needed by the researchers as stated by Nasrani 
(2015)  in his/her  study entitled “Qualitative and descriptive research: Data type versus 
data analysis. Language Teaching Research”.    
Agile Software Development      
An agile software development process always starts by defining the users and 
documenting a vision statement on a scope of problems, opportunities, and values to be 24 
 
addressed. The product owner captures this vision and works w ith a multidisciplinary 
team (or teams) to deliver on this vision as stated by Sacolick (2020) in his/her article 
entitled “What is agile methodology? Modern software development explained”. In 
addition, according to Soni (2017)  in his/her  study entitled “ Cost Estimation Model for 
Web Applications using Agile Software Development Methodology” states that it is 
also a continuous cycle that will make the system more flexible in any changes or 
upgrades. Unlike traditional software development that is based on factors such as 
requirements, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and testing 
whereas agile is based on iteration which operates on confirmed requirements, develop, 
test system then release.   
In a study of Harrison (2016) entitled “A Sec urity Evaluation Framework for 
U.K. E -Government Services Agile Software Development”, Agile has been adopted 
by the majority of Government digital departments including the Government Digital   
Services. Agile, despite its ability to achieve high rates of  productivity organized 
in short, flexible, iterations, has faced security professionals' disbelief when working 
within the U.K. Government. One of the major issues is that they develop in Agile but 
the accreditation process is conducted using Waterfall re sulting in delays to go live 
dates.   
 A recent study by Abrahamsson (2017) and his partners entitled “ Agile Software 
Development Methods: Review and Analysis ” showed that in the last 25 years, a wide 
variety of different approaches related to software dev elopment have been introduced, 
with only a few of them surviving in today’s world. It is also argued that traditional 
information systems and their methods behind the development are primarily treated as 
a basic necessity for presenting an image of control  towards symbolic status. However, 
these methods are too mechanistic and should not be used in details. Due to which this 25 
 
research tries to evaluate some of the best software agile management methods, which 
can be used by the organizations by providing the  background and critical review of 
software agile methods.  
 Taylor  (2016)  in his/her  research focused on understanding how agile techniques 
shaped the practices of project managers, and how they dealt with conflict. Her findings 
focused on how change in me thods influence human experience and can cause some 
conflict. She also identified how project managers should relinquish some control when 
using agile.   
 However, according to Esquivel (2016)  in his/her  research entitled 
“Communication Issues in Agile Software Development”, it is a common increasingly 
practice that the teams are in geographically dispersed places, which means that it is 
necessary to adapt and/or look for the way that this methodology is suitable in these 
contexts. There are many experiences in the industry where we can see communication 
issues due to this kind work. The new agile methods have evoked substantial amount 
of literature and debates, Abrahamsson (2017), “ Agile Software Developm ent Methods: 
Review and Analysis ”. 
 Based on Bick, Spohrer, Hoda, Scheerer, & Heinzl, (2018) in their research 
entitled “Coordination Challenges in Large -Scale Software Development: A Case 
Study of Planning Misalignment in Hybrid Settings”, over time, soft ware developers 
may therefore apply agile methods to varying degrees, alternate between plan -driven 
and agile methods, and even apply plan -driven and agile methods at the same time. 
Therefore, conceptualize the extent of agile method use as the frequency a nd intensity 
with which developers apply agile methods in a particular project.  
  Suryaatmaja (2019)  in his/her  in their paper entitled “The Missing Framework 
for Adaptation of Agile Software Development Projects”, a study of implementation of 26 
 
software dev elopment in an insurance company name “Preeminence” in Jakarta, 
Indonesia finds  that several people who had been using Agile mentioned that they need 
some accommodation when implementing Agile during a project. Unlike the 
researcher’s client some cooperati ves have confirmed that they would like to 
collaborate to the proposed system. It will be an efficient way to build the project with 
the help of the cooperatives.    
  According to the principles of agile methodology, especially “On -site 
Customer” and “Ada ptive Planning” principles of Asfour, Zain, Salleh, & Grundy 
(2019)  in their research entitled “ Exploring Agile Mobile App Development in 
Industrial Contexts: A Qualitative Study. International Journal of Technology in 
Education and Science ”, the only crit erion for developing a new version was a new 
demand posed by the participants, and the only criterion for the fulfillment of the 
demand was the feedback received from the participants. Therefore, the ultimate 
purpose of the current investigation was to dev elop a custom -made mobile app to meet 
all the demands of the participants of this study.  
 As per Harrison (2016)  in his/her  study entitled “A Security Evaluation 
Framework for U.K. E -Government Services Agile Software Development”, agile has 
been adopted b y the majority of Government digital departments including the 
Government Digital Services. Agile, despite its ability to achieve high rates of 
productivity organized in short, flexible, iterations, has faced security professional’s 
disbelief when working within the U.K. Government.  
 On contrary, according to Meier (2018)  in his/her  study entitled “Stress in agile 
software development: practices and outcomes”, suggested that stress might still be 
commonplace in Agile teams, especially for those with less ex perience. They also 
noticed that newcomers to Agile emphasized technical, rather than collaborative, 27 
 
practices, and speculated this might explain the stress. But according to Kropp (2020) 
study, found that higher satisfaction is reported more by those usin g Agile development 
than with plan -driven processes and found that certain practices and impacts have high 
correlations to satisfaction, and that collaborative processes are closely related to 
satisfaction.  
 According to F. K. Chan and Thong (2016)  in the ir research entitled “ Modelling 
the critical success factors of agile software development projects in South Africa ”, 
traditional  methodologies of software development are based on two assumptions: first 
they assume that customers do not know their require ments, but developers know, and 
second, customers cannot foresee their needs, so developers should provide them with 
extra features for their probable needs in future. They continued that contrary to the 
traditional methodologies, agile methodology assumes  that neither customers nor 
developers know completely what the system requirements are, therefore, they 
cooperate to find out the most suitable aspects and features to be implemented in the 
software or application.  
   Moreover, according to Biswas (2017)  in his/her  research  entitled “Agile 
software development methodologies, process and implementation in sort?”, states that 
in agile development, researchers are not afraid of any kind of changes in the project. 
It must view changes to the requirement s as good things, because those changes mean 
that the researcher has learned more about what will be the best way to satisfy the 
customers/cooperatives otherwise, the desired outcome of the system would be 
impossible to achieve. So, without being said, the  researcher and the cooperatives 
collaboration will be a great way to have concrete standard system that would benefit 
the cooperatives here in district  4.   28 
 
Web -Based  System  
With the growing use of Internet, demand for intelligent and user -friendly 
applic ations is increasing continuously. Thus, providing with the user -friendly 
application where desktop resides within the web browser. As the Internet is easily 
accessible from any corner of the world the user can access this web application anytime 
from anyw here. Web -based Application is work as a normal operating system where 
applications provided by it can be handled just like using the normal desktop based on 
Andhale (2017)  in his/her  research entitled “ Web -based Application. International 
Journal of Advan ced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering ”. 
According to Gibb (2016)  in his/her  article entitled “What is a Web 
Application?”, states that millions of businesses use the Internet as a cost -effective 
communications channel. It lets them exchange information with their target market and 
make fast, secure transactions. However, effectiv e engagement is only possible when 
the business is able to capture and store all the necessary data, and have a means of 
processing this information and presenting the results to the user. Web applications use 
a combination of server -side scripts (PHP and ASP) to handle the storage and retrieval 
of the information, and client -side scripts (JavaScript and HTML) to present information 
to users. This allows users to interact with the company using online forms, content 
management systems, shopping carts and mo re. In addition, the applications allow 
employees to create documents, share information, collaborate on projects, and work on 
common documents regardless of location or device.  
According to Prabawa (2018)  in his/her  research entitled “Design and 
applicati on of savings and loans in cooperation Jala Bhakti Sedana based web”, the 
solution offered is the making of web -based application for savings and loan activity in 
cooperative of Jala Bhakti Sedana which is able to record all the savings and loan 29 
 
transactio n and doing surplus calculation. This application has several main processes 
such as savings and loan data recording, calculation of operating profit, calculation of 
surplus allocation, calculation of savings surplus, and calculation of loan surplus. After  
being tested, this application is able to help the officer to note savings and loan 
transaction in cooperative. Besides, it also helps treasury officer making cooperative 
surplus counting so that it can be distributed to all member on time annually.  
Likew ise, according to Montecuollo (2015)  in his/her  article entitled “Native or 
Web -based? selecting the right approach for your mobile app”, he pointed out that the 
biggest upside to a web -based approach is, of course, the biggest downside to a native 
one. Wh en developing a web -based app you are centralizing your offering. Users of any 
mobile device (iPhone, Android; even Blackberry, Palm, and future devices that don't 
exist yet) will be able to access the app and use it immediately. In addition to this, 
updat es to your app can happen in real -time "automagically.” And The paper reports that 
might take days to prepare and distribute can be replaced on online reports and digital 
dashboards. That can improve the quality and the speed of decision making, right acro ss 
an organization. Web based custom application development can provide businesses 
with significant cost savings and productivity improvements. Now that internet access 
is almost universally available and internet speeds have significantly improved, 
appli cations that previously had to be client based can now be deployed on the web 
based on Kambala (2018)  in his/her  article entitled  “Benefits of Web -Based Systems for 
Business ”. 
In contrast, according to Yeeply (2017)  in his/her  article entitled “Advantages 
and disadvantages of web app development”, a single web app is able to reach out to all 
devices. The website must, of course, be programmed in a way it can be shown 30 
 
regardless of the device’s operating system. If it’s not a responsive website, you could 
experience problems when displaying it on iOS, Android, or Windows Phone.  
Also, if your website undergoes any kind of issue, your application will be in 
trouble too. Don’t assume that your web app will work perfectly if you don’t have a 
quality corporate web site, an Internet connection will be an absolute must to run it, it 
will also lose visibility as it will not be on display in the stores, there will be some access 
restrictions as to certain hardware features of the device it’s running on said Picurelli 
(2017) in his/her  article entitled “ Advantages and disadvantages of web app 
development ”. 
In terms of security, according to Lvivity (2018)  in his/her  article entitled “Web -
Based Application: What It Is, and Why You Should Use It”, Web -based applications 
are run on dedicated servers which are constantly moderated by professional Web 
administrators. This means that any possible errors or intrusions will be noticed and 
addressed quickly. As a result, a web -based system is a lot more secure than its desktop 
analog.  
Moreover, based on Thomas (2015)  in his/her  article entitled “ The benefits of 
using web -based applications ” Web -based applications offer a good way of accessing 
centralized data securely. Servers will only be accessed directly by the person or team 
managing them. Through the use of cloud computing, servers can be fully redundant and 
replicated to prevent downtime as a result of a disaster. This avoids the need to maintain 
the security of every device on which the application is being used. Overall, the  risk of 
unauthorized access is reduced and putting security measures in place is simpler, since 
it is done centrally,  
 
 31 
 
PHP Advantages  
 According to Wilks (2019)  in his/her  article entitled “What is the role of PHP in 
web development?”, A PHP developer is responsible for writing server -side web 
application logic and while they usually develop back -end components, connect the 
application with the other (often third -party) web  services, they also support the front -
end developers by integrating their work with the application. As you can see, there are 
several reasons that PHP is so widely used in the world of web development, possessing 
a large community of developers, forums a nd benefits.  
 Benefits such as Cross -Platform, PHP is an application can be run on various 
platforms. The most important advantage of PHP is the developer need not have to worry 
about the operating system the user is working on. As the PHP code run proper ly and 
smoothly on all operating systems. Furthermore, the server -side scripting language or 
PHP hosting service providers can easily be found based on omkarsoft (2017)  in his/her  
article entitled “Top 5 Advantages and Disadvantages of PHP Framework”.  
 According to Jain (2020)  in his/her  article entitled “here are advantages and 
disadvantages of using php”, the built -in features and tools of the PHP framework make 
it easy to protect applications from security hazards and external applications. Security 
hazards can be data manipulation, SQL injection and forgery, etc. To avoid such security 
threats, developers are utilizing the PHP framework for developing a web application.  
 In contrast, according to Roznovsky (2019) in his/her  article entitled “Why use 
php?  Main advantages and disadvantages”, the reason for PHP having a bad reputation 
regarding its security is the low entry barrier for novice programmers. As a result, a 
number of websites and apps are developed by inexperienced coders, trainees, or even 
hobb yists. The shoddy results of their work contribute to the rumors and facts regarding 
overall bad security and performance of PHP. However, if you refer to a development 32 
 
company with a good reputation and a team of experienced and certified specialists, you  
shouldn’t worry about the security of your product.  
 In addition, since it is open sourced, all people can see the source code. If there 
are bugs in the source code, it can be used by people to explore the weakness of it based 
on Deepak (2017) article en titled “ Advantages and Disadvantages of PHP ”. 
 Overall, according to Bezborodykh (2018)  in his/her  article entitled “7 Reasons 
to Choose PHP Web Development for Business IT Solutions”, a great advantage of PHP 
is its versatility and flexibility. PHP code i s compatible with all major platforms from 
Windows, Unix, and Linux to MacOS. It supports most of the servers (including Apache, 
Microsoft IIS, Netscape, iPlanet, Caudium, Xitami, Tornado etc.) and more than 20 
databases (for example, MySQL, MongoDB, Postg reSQL, and others). THat’s why PHP 
is often chosen for creating cross -platform applications: it allows businesses to leverage 
the existing infrastructure with minimal expenditures.  
 Moreover, PHP is highly popular among hosting providers. All reliable hosting 
services company support PHP and provides hosting services for sites on it. They 
provide PHP support at no extra charge or low -cost plans with an unlimited volume and 
a free domain name. So, now it's clear that the main business advantages  of PHP are its 
economy, scalability, simplicity, compatibility, and convenience, based on Scott (2019)  
in his/her  article entitled “PHP or WordPress: Which is Better for Your Business and 
Why?”.  
 
 
 
 
 33 
 
Synthesis   
  Over the past decades, governments and ot her public and private sector have 
using ICT in enhancing their services to the citizens. It also benefits both citizen and 
organizations in which it would boost the data processing. However, the only challenges 
in this situation is that the citizen or peo ple do not have enough/ adequate information 
about this kind of technology. Moreover, ICT have a huge impact in an organization 
with sustainability and more importantly it reduces the corruption inside.   Cooperative 
is a type of organization own by its me mbers, who is also happen to use the services 
and products of the cooperative. It is different from other companies, because they are 
formed and operate for the benefit of their members and helps mainly low -income 
family to improved their financial positio n. There are pros and cons of having and 
joining in a cooperative, but overall cooperatives play a significant role in defining and 
sustaining the lives of the communities.    
  Shakya (2019), Andreansyah (2020), Arisandy (2019), and Ramdhani (2018) 
agrees  that cooperatives recognize the importance of technology in a cooperative 
helping to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cooperative work and expected. 
While Hidayati (2018) and Rachman (2020) pointed out that it can cause problems like 
old search  data, inaccurate borrowing, inaccurate reports as well as connectivity 
problems between divisions that caused by weak connectivity, technical disturbances 
such as exposed to malware, the internet network is weak and so on.  
Montecuollo  (2015) and Kambala (2018) agreed about having a web -based 
application with a lower development cost, accessible anywhere, centralized security, 
efficiency and more. While Yeeply (2017) and Picurelli (2017) both give disadvantages 
of creating a web -based a pplication like it should be programmed in a way it can be 
shown regardless of the device’s operating system, if it’s not a responsive website, it 34 
 
can cause problem on other devices. In terms of security on PHP, Jain (2020) and 
foundomkarsoft (2017), PHP m ake it easy to protect applications from security hazards 
and external applications. Security hazards can be data manipulation, SQL injection and 
forgery, etc. In contrast Roznovsky (2019) states that the reason for PHP having a bad 
reputation regarding it s security is the low entry barrier for novice programmers. As a 
result, a number of websites and apps are developed by inexperienced coders, trainees, 
or even hobbyists. However, PHP is highly popular among hosting providers. All 
reliable hosting services  company support PHP and provides hosting services for sites 
on it.

CHAPTER III  
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
This chapter defines the research methods and procedures used to conduct the 
study. Chapter sections include: research design, population of the study, sampling 
design, data collection instruments,  statistical treatment,  project design , software 
development model, testing and evaluation procedure . The researcher explains how the 
essential data and information was collected, presen ted, analyzed.  
Research Design  
In order to satisfy the researcher’s objectives, descriptive and d evelopmental 
research design were used.  
The most common descriptive research method is the survey, which includes 
questionnaires, personal interviews, phone s urveys, and normative surveys. The goal  of 
descriptive research  is to describe a phenomenon and its characteristics. According to 
Macombes (2019) article about “Descriptive Research”, descriptive research aims to 
accurately and systematically describe a po pulation, situation or phenomenon.  He added 
descriptive research can use both qualitative and quantitative research methods thus 
making it more carefully developed to ensure the results are valid and reliable. Thus, 
observation and survey tools are commonl y used in collecting and gathering all the data 
needed by the researchers (Nassaji, 2015).   
A developmental research method is  often associated with participatory action 
research, combining research and practice in such a way that the study  brings about so me 
situational improvement and research increases the broader understanding of the issue , 
Hasan  (2003) .  
 
 36 
 
Locale of the study  
 In the preliminary investigation of the researchers, the researchers conducted an 
interview to five (5) different cooperatives with their secretaries namely the NMBPC, 
PGMNHCOOP, NEMCO, LEMCO, SUMAPI. In addition, the researchers conducted 
interview to the  PCDO office with Mr. Noly S. Balboa, the Supervising Cooperative 
Development Specialist in PCDO.  
 There are 5 categories or groups of respondents from General Managers, 
Secretary, Loaners, IT Professionals, PCDO Liaison  who will the respondents for the 
User Acceptance Questionnaires (TAM). And the researchers find IT -experts who test 
the System being developed.  
Population  of the study  
The target populations of this study were respondents directly from the District 
4 in Laguna Cooperatives including the PCDO, General Manager s, Secretar ies, and the 
loaner s that was being interviewed during the preliminary investigation.  This sampling 
method was conducted where each member of the population had chosen to be part of 
the sample  representing from District 4 .   
Table 1.  Respondents of the Study. This table shows the population of the respondents 
in evaluating the developed sy stem. Formula in finding the percentage:  
(𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 =(𝑋)(100)

POPULATION  PERCENTAGE  
General Managers  5 3 9.09%  
Secretary  5 2 6.06%  
Loaners  30 24 72.73%  
PCDO Liaison  1 1 3.03%  
Total  44 33 100%  
 
 37 
 
 The respondents are chosen based on the PCDO where the researcher initially 
interviewed and because PCDO know about the people inside a cooperative and which 
people should be the right respondents for this study.  Due to the pandemic the researcher 
limits their target population to which is accessible only. Instead of 5 General managers 
the researcher was able to conduct and test the system to only 3 General managers due 
to the unavailability. Secretary with 5 targ et population and 2 on accessible. Loaners 
with 30 target population and 24 accessible population, IT professional with 3 on target 
and accessible population and lastly 1 in PCDO Liaison on target and accessible 
population.  
Sampling Design  
The researcher’ s choses the Purposive  Sampling for the reason of breaking down 
the population according to the importance to the study of the sampling category. The 
sampling design would help the researchers in data gathering especially at the big 
population of the study . Sampling is the process by which inference is made to the whole 
by examining a part. The purpose of sampling is to provide various types of statistical 
information of a qualitative or quantitative nature about the whole by examining a few 
selected units.   
  According to Ames  (2019) research entitled “ Purposive sampling in a qualitative 
evidence synthesis: a worked example from a synthesis on parental perceptions of 
vaccination communication ”. The reason for purposive sampling is the better matching 
of the  sample to the aims and objectives of the research, thus improving the rigor of the 
study and trustworthiness of the data and results. Four aspects to this concept have 
previously been described: credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmabili ty 
according to Campbell (2020) research entitled “ Purposive sampling: complex or 
simple? Research case examples ”. 38 
 
  In the study, the researchers would categorize the different cooperatives into by 
types of cooperative, for the researchers are to focus in  the studying the credit 
cooperative but the researchers still needed to know the processes and services of other 
cooperatives. Then, the researchers would categorize the officers into the positions of 
the officers, and then randomly pick to the categorize s to the created sample size. With 
this method the researchers would easily find out the problems of the cooperatives and 
can easily think the best solutions to the problems based on the categories of different 
officers and types of cooperatives.

defined  as an expert in teacher with full range of knowledge , in which our IT -experts 
are all instructions teacher IT courses.  
Data Collection Instruments   
The researchers used various type of method in order to collect data and 
information for the development of the research study. The methods are listed below:  
Questionnaire: The  researchers used questionnaires and give it to the members 
of the cooperative i n order to have more insights from the member of the cooperative 
without interviewing them one by one, this was  used during preliminary investigation .  
Interview : The researchers gather data through face -to-face interview from  
different managers and people inside a cooperative with consent and approval from the 
cooperative management, asking questions that needed in order to have sufficient 
information for the research , this was  used during preliminary invest igation. 
Audio Reco rder: Throughout  the interview the researchers used audio recording 
to be able to track and revert information in cased it is needed.  
Observation:  the researchers also watch and observed what the environment would look 
like and especially how the cooperat ives operate, thus, helping the researcher to have a 
perspective in a wider view. And help provides highly detailed information about the 
natural process of each cooperatives.  
Internet Research:  The researchers also used internet research especially in th is 
case where the project will be a web -based system, it is also the most efficient way to 
have all the information from different studies and source s during the study .  
Library Research:  The researchers studied and read other related capstone 
project from previous years related to the cooperatives system and data management 
system  in LSPU Library , this was used during preliminary investigation . 40 
 
Consultation : The researchers consult people like IT experts and advisers to 
better understand and fi nd a solution on how and what are the best solutions in building 
the system to have a better output  all throughout the study . 
Statistical Treatment  
In order  to analyze the data, the researcher gather data through the use of 
Statistical Treatment. The researcher used Weighted Mean and the Standard Deviation.  
Weighted Mean  
Weighted Mean = ( SA*5) + (A* 4) + (MA*3) + (D*2) + (SD*1)

Project Design  
Software Development Methodology is a series of processes used in software 
development with different phases design moving from one phase to another.   
The researcher will use Agile Software Development and it starts by defining the 
users and documenting a  vision statement on a problems, opportunities, and values 
addressed (Sacolick, 2020). It is also a continuous cycle that will make the system more 
flexible in any changes or upgrades. Unlike traditional software development that is 
based on factors such a s requirements, analysis, design, implementation, testing, 
deployment and testing whereas agile is based on iteration which operates on confirmed 
requirements, develop, test system then release (Soni, 2017).  
In addition, it gained popularity because it em phasized collaboration with 
client/customers, communication among the researcher and on demand change in 
requirements meaning it is a team work rather than the individual which contribute to 
collective effort. But, in Suryaatmaja (2019) in their paper enti tled “The Missing 
Framework for Adaptation of Agile Software Development Projects”, a study of 
implementation of software development in an insurance company name t. Unlike the 
researcher’s client some cooperatives have confirmed that they would like to co llaborate 
to the proposed system. It will be an efficient way to build the project with the help of 
the cooperatives.    
Moreover, (Biswas, 2017) in agile development, researchers are not afraid of any 
kind of changes in the project. It must view changes to the requirements as good things, 42 
 
because those changes mean that the researcher has learned more about what will be the  
best way to satisfy the customers/cooperatives otherwise, the desired outcome of the 
system would be impossible to achieve.  
Software Methodology  
 
Figure 2. Agile Software Development  illustrate the process and flow of the model used 
by the researchers t o follow in order to build a system.  
  
The Agile Software Development Cycle Stages:  
Planning  
In this stage the researchers planned all the different strategies in formulating the 
idea and developing it into a system. And in this stage interviews, consultation, 
researches, and different activities needed to be done was applied in here to really know 
of the problems encountered by the client.  First and for most the researchers consults the 
adviser and project specialist to understand and to know how the researchers will take 
its first step before doing anything else like interviewing the cooperatives. After that, the 
researcher goes to the PCDO in Sta. Cruz, Laguna in order to facilitate us to the 
cooperatives residing in District 4, and a lso the researcher took the opportunity to 
interview the Supervising Cooperative Development Specialist  Mr. Noly Balboa on how 
a cooperative operate in terms on loaning management  and he gave the researcher s all 
43 
 
the data  and information  needed especially t he contact of several cooperatives  which the 
other days and weeks where the researchers interviewed . Through this, the researcher 
was able to identify all the problems that the cooperatives encountering.  
Analysis  
The stage where the researchers Critically think of different solutions that would 
best fit to answer the problems encountered by the client and any other proposed 
solutions from the researchers based on the  analysis of the adviser, instructors, and 
teachers who are well qualified of the  said study.  The researcher rigorously examines 
and analyze which is the best system that will provide a solution on the current state of 
the cooperatives. So, the researchers come up to a solution making first all the blueprint s 
such as Use Case Diagram, Entity Relational Diagram, Data Flow Diagram, Current 
Process Flow, and the Proposed Process Flow to guide the researcher in building the 
system.  
Design  
The designing of the system in which the planning and analysis stages where 
being applied by the resear chers unto the system development. The design was being 
planned by the given range of specific time. The design is one of the most important 
part of the stages for it planning would be appli ed. The researchers first design a web -
based system that will enab le all smartphone and desktop device s used by the end user  
to quickly access the system . The researcher used PHP as the programming language 
for web -based system and also bootstrap to give more responsive UI and user -friendly 
interface. MySQL were used to store  all the inputs and outputs data in the system, and 
creating an encrypted database to secure all the confidential information.  
 
 44 
 
Implementation  
The implementation is the installing of the system to the PCDO and 
Cooperatives. In this stage the researchers would discuss to the different user  
(PCDO officer, Cooperative Officers, and to the Loaners) of on how to use the system. 
Basically, the system i s not that hard to use, based on the objective the system is a user 
friendly which means it is to used and can be understand by the non -IT experts . The 
researcher tries to implement this through online by giving the PCDO and other 
cooperatives to be able t o access the system that would give comments and insights 
whether the system is highly accepted.  
Testing and Integration  
In this stage Testing and Integration of the system would be applied. The 
researchers test the system to the cooperative to test and u se its function if it makes the 
operation of the cooperatives change into a simple and easy way.  All the programs and 
functions being created during the development stages would be now in life through 
testing it to the client’s offices.  The cooperatives  find errors or the lack of a function  to 
the developed system and the researcher thoroughly  remove the non -important features 
in the system that turn the system more in hassle of the operation of the cooperative  and 
giving the cooperative more distinct syst em that will help ease of doing their business 
in a loaning system .  
Maintenance  
This stage would allow the admin or the developers to get in touch with the 
system based on the request of the clients. The maintenance stage is to make sure that 
the system i s functioning as of what it must do since the implementation.  
 
 45 
 
Testing and Evaluation Procedures  
 To address the if the system is working properly and ready to use by the 
cooperative, the researchers seek the help of IT expert as a test subject in order to assess 
the system and assure its quality and capability. The evaluation test sheets for the syste m 
will to analyze if the given system is performing well.  
The researcher used Black Box Testing Tool to test the developed system.  It is 
also known as  Specifications based testing. The researchers  usually perform this type of 
testing during the software testing life cycle  with is Agile Method .  
Based on Lonetti (2018) research entitled “ Emerging Software Testing 
Technologies ”, Black -box testing, also called functional testing, relies on the 
input/output behavior of the system. In particular, the system is subjected to external 
inputs, so that the corresponding outputs are used to verify the conformance of the 
system to the speci fied behavior, with no assumptions of what happens in between.  
 
Testing Tools  
This section shows system testing tools provided all discussion about the 
developed system. Tools that researchers used  supports one or more test activities right 
from planning,  requirements, creating a build, test execution, defect logging and test 
analysis.  And to have a desirable system which suits to the requirements and

Testing Procedures  
 The researchers created a Black box testing questionnaire that was being 
uploaded to the google form. The researches included in the black box testing all the 
functions and features that every button d oes. The researchers choose three (3) 
Information Technology Professionals, in general they are IT -instructors at Laguna State 
Polytechnic University . This section shows the black box testing tool and TAM 
(Technology Acceptance Method) used by the research ers’ study. This method includes 
system testing or software testing where testing method were used.  
Evaluation Tools  
This section shows system evaluation  tools provided all discussion about the 
developed system. The evaluation tool being used is the Techn ology Acceptance Model 
(TAM) with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and with its level 
of agreement scaling of five (5) in the Likert Scale. Before the deployment of the 
Evaluation Questionnaires, it was first validated by an authori ty of the study.   
The purpose of this Evaluation is to test the acceptability of the developed system 
by its user, for the researchers want to test its Quality Factors, Perceived Ease of use, 
Perceived Usefulness, Attitude Towards Using, Behavioral Intent ions, and Experience.  
According to the study of Charness (2016) “ Technology Acceptance 
Model  (TAM;  Davis, 1989) has been one of the most influential models of technology 
acceptance, with two primary factors influencing an individual’s intention to use new 
technology: perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. ”

Evaluation Procedure  
Design and Development of the Questionnaire  
Likert scale is a five (or seven) point scale which is used to allow the individual 
to express how much they agree or disagree with a particular statement.  There are five 
Likert Scale classifications in terms of level of acceptability, the Unacceptable (U), 
Slightly Unacceptable (SU), Neutral (N ), Slightly Acceptable (SA), Acceptable (A).  
 According to Mcleod article entitled “ Likert Scale Definition, Examples and 
Analysis ”, Likert Scales have the advantage that they do not expect a simple yes / no 
answer from the respondent, but rather allow for  degrees of opinion, and even no opinion 
at all.  
Validation of Questionnaire  
 The researchers created a set of questionnaires in order to acquire data. The data 
was analyzed and interpret to know the level of acceptability of the cooperatives.  The 
questio n used were from the objectives of the research study and design using TAM 
(Technology Acceptance Model) to know if the system developed was well -suited to 
use by the Cooperatives.   
Deployment of the Evaluation  
 The researchers indeed use the modern technology in gathering the data for the 
Technology Acceptance Model, the google form.  The google form was being used with 
the video attached on it. The reason of using the google form is that the researchers can’t 
go outside because of the COVID 19 pandemic.

CHAPTER IV  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 This chapter present s the analysis, results of the study and interpretation of the 
test results acquired from testing and surveys by the researchers. It also discusses if the 
“Integration of Cooperative under PCDO Loaning Management System” has fulfilled 
the needs and requirem ents of the clients.  
Research Objectives No. 1: To design and develop a system that contains an 
Integrated online and offline loaning management system that can be used by Credit 
Cooperatives registered in PCDO.  
 Based on the researchers interview on PCD O and other cooperatives like we had 
before on Palasan Multipurpose Cooperative, NEMCO and others, the following 
problems they are facing are; 1.) The PCDO takes a long time in replying to the request 
of seminars each cooperative for the PCDO still need to  match their own schedule with 
the cooperatives. 2.) Cooperatives management of records is not in good situation that 
causes loss of records, and took a long period of time of searching of the past records. 
3) The lack of management of records causes an ef fect to the cooperative’s members 
and it causes a double payment for not updating the book even if the loaner had already 
paid. 4.) The cooperative can’t view the previous record of the its new members and to 
check if the loaners have no debt at other coop erative.  
Figure 3. The figure shows the preliminary investigation and interview to the PCDO 
and some Cooperatives and also to observed inside.  
57 
 
Based on the data and information that has been gathered, the researcher design 
and develop a system that would h elp the cooperatives . The design is one of the most 
important part of the stages for it planning would be applied. The researchers developed 
a system using Java Script and PHP as a programming language and MY SQL for 
database. This phase included the internet research and online consultation with the 
programmers who teaches us of how to solve code and database errors. The consultation 
was a great help that it added new learning to the researchers that was being applied in 
the study.  
By achieving the Ob jective of this research , the figures below show all the 
designs of the systems that has been developed by the researchers.

Research Objective No. 2: To test the functionalities of the developed Loaning 
Management System based on the behavior of the system during the testing phase 
focusing on its features:  
The researchers conduct a black box testing to test its functionality, usability and 
other features of the sys tem. The test was being conducted in two -ways: Face to face 
system testing and the online system testing.  
The result of black box testing used by researchers to test the systems capabilities 
and functionalities were passed by the researchers three IT prof essional tester. All the 
results were concluded that the system was fully functional according to the standard of 
the IT who tested it, making more efficient and easier to use by the cooperatives. The 
table below show the results from the three IT Professi onal tester via google meet and 
face-to-face demonstration.

Research Objective No. 3:  To evaluate the level of acceptability using the 
developed system in term of: (a)Quality Factors, (b)Perceive ease of use, (c)Perceive 
usefulness, (d)Attitude towards using, (e)Behavioral intention to use, and (f)Experience.  
The researchers provide questionnaire, but in order to accommodate and reach 
out the target respondents during pandemic, the researchers used google form as a mean 
to conduct evaluation without violating the Health and Safety Protocol during pandemic.  
The respondents give their own rating and personal opinion through a 
questionnaire. The researcher used TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) as an 
evaluation tool format to know if the system developed were capable and performing 
well in real life scenario.  
The result based on the evaluation done by the researchers; it shows that respondents 
answered it “Strongly Agree”.

CHAPTER V  
Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations  
This Chapter is represented in four sections. The first section discuss the overall 
summary of the study, followed by summary of the findings and their conclusions. And 
lastly the recommendations for the future research.  
Summary of the Study  
This study wa s conducted on PCDO and other cooperatives as its main 
respondents of the study. Descriptive and Developmental Research was used in this 
study. The researcher used testing tool such as black box testing with TAM to ensure 
that the system was capable under its standard as a system and to the standard of the 
end-user.  
The problem was identified to determine the factors affecting the Cooperative in 
dealing with the process of loaning. After obtaining data and information about the 
cooperative loaning system, the researchers come up with an objective that will help the 
cooperative with their current problems they are facing.  
After designing and building the system, the researcher used testing tools and 
producers to evaluate if the system were capable and funct ioning well. Black box testing 
as a testing tool, TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) as its user acceptability testing 
through the use of Google Form in order to maintain and follow the standard health care 
protocol during Pandemic. The researcher chooses P urposive sampling so that the 
respondents have their background inside in a cooperative and managing the cooperative 
as well, making it more reliable in conducting the evaluation.  
After administering the questionnaire and evaluation to the respondents and  to the 
IT professional tester, the researcher used weighted mean and standard deviation to the 
determined the level of acceptability  82 
 
Conclusion  
The PCDO and the cooperatives under it has been concerned about the manual 
and slow process inside a loaning management. The study conducted was made possible 
through personal interviews with the cooperatives, research and observations. The 
cooperatives en countered problems such as manual processes in : registering, recording, 
keeping, and updating the records that they have  which result in slow process inside.  
1. The researcher design and develops a system  that would help the cooperative 
managing and providing  a fast service in a loaning system. Helping the 
cooperative and the members as well. The system “Integration of Cooperative 
under PCDO Loaning Management System” will help overcome and improved 
the overall loaning service.  
2. The result of black box testing  used by researchers to test the systems capabilities 
and functionalities were passed by the researchers three IT professional tester. 
All the results were concluded that the system was fully functional according to 
the standard of the IT who tested.  
3. Based  on the data gathered through evaluation and testing, the overall weighted 
mean of all results in evaluation interpreted as “Strongly Agree”. Through this, 
the problem of the cooperative concerning on the loaning management inside 
has been fulfilled.  
The researcher therefore concludes that the “Integration of Cooperative under 
PCDO Loaning Management System” is the solution to their problem which is manual 
process of loaning management.  
 
 
 83 
 
Recommendations  
The “Integration of Cooperative under PCDO Loaning Management System” 
was built to improve the loaning management of cooperatives, the following 
recommendations are listed based on the works accomplished during this research and 
on the conclusion given:  
1. The future researchers might implement it more to give more credential to this 
system which the current researchers are incapable of because the researchers 
are in the midst of pandemic.  
2. This research can be used to improve the overall functionally of the Loaning 
Management System.  
3. The researchers recomme nd to have a bigger scope and respondents through 
evaluation and testing increasing its realizability and functionality.

nag wiwidraw member pa rin sila.  96 
 
Researher 2 saka po matanong  ko lang pala mam ung process po sa loan  ung pagiging 
member po ng teachers sa lending…  
Gen. manager: so sila entitled magloan pag nagloan sila regular o kaya  agency pero 
dahil hindi nakakabayd naglimit kami na isa lang   
ang loan kung kalian nakabayad n kayo ng 80% saka lang ulit   
kayo makakapagloan kasi nga minsan alam mo na man loan   
dito loan doon…tapos di na nakakabayad..

share capital na kailangan ay ibayad nila   
maglalabas syempre ng pera dito halimbawa ung 5,000 tapos   
kailangan nila umattend ng seminars kapag hindi nakaattend   
ng seminars…hindi pa…kasi kailangan pirmahan ng BOD   
approbahan ng Board of director..ung kanilang membership   
kailangan un para malaman nila ang responsibilities nila pede   
kasi un ma appro ved at pede madis approved…kasi mahirap   97

Researher 3: ah eh mam paano po ung mga hindi nakakapagbayad sa  inyo…  
Gen. manager: teneterminate namin binibigyan namin ng notice para  malaman nila

So kumpleto na,so gusto po mangyari ni pastor noly ung process po ng  system na meron

Proponents 1: may system na po kayo…  
Ms.Normilyn: ahhh…kasi what I can give you  is kung paano nagrurun ung system pero  
ung the detail of the system kung saan sya nagrurun wala…o paano ang  program 
wala…kasi wala dito ung provider namin at tsaka hindi ko din  nga alam kung basta ko 
sya pede ibigay kasi may provider yan  
Researher 2 :un nga po mam un din po ung sabi samin kanina ni sir ung admin staff  po

Researhe r 2: ah eh..un lang naman sinuggest samin ni pastor..  
Ms.Normilyn: kaya un eh panu di ko maano kung paano natin pag uusapan yan.  paano 
natin pag uusapan yang system naming…papaano?  
Researher 2: ah Mam siguro ganito nalang…ikwento nyo nalang po sa amin k ung ok  
lang mula sa pagreregister hanggang sa payment lang po sya Mam  kung pede lang po 
mam ung process po.  
Ms.Normilyn: pwede naman…  
Researher 2: pero no needs ng mga ano…kahit attributes lang  
Ms.Normilyn: ahh ok… So ganito kasi  
Researher 2: pwede p o magrecord?  
Ms.Normilyn: ok, Yung aming system kasi ano sya Credit Services with accounting  
System siya tas meron siyang with MIS , kaya sya nagsisimula sya sa  lahat doon sa MIS 
so doon sa members information so kapag ung  member naming ung individual nagpunta 
sya dito nag pamember sya  dito, so un ung unang empleyado nya sa system naming,so 
gagawan  sya ng membership number sa membership number nya andoon ung  lahat ng 
info na tungkol sa kanya doon sa ano nya sa module na yun  And then doon din sya 
gagawan ng account number kasi may account  number ung pera na eiinvest dito so 
ginagawan din ng account number  yun so un ung ginagawa sa MIS actually doon sa 
membership number  doon tapos doon pag andun na ung records mo sa MIS 
mapapalipat  kana doon sa mod ule ng maintenance so doon sa module ng  maintenance 
doon sya naming gagawan ng account number kung  anong klaseng account number 
ang gagawin sa kanya so ayan so may  records kana sa amin. Kapag ikaw naman ay 
magloloan na ,ok  magbabayad meron namang isang  module doon tellering naman iyon  
so lahat ng papasok na pera papsok na payment sa tellering dumadaan  so doon sya 
kung anu ano ang account naming doon sya pumapasok sa  tellering, pagpasok sa 
tellering interconnected naman sya doon eh,  pagpasok doon dah il may records naman 
sya esearch lang doon lalabas  nayun doon interconnected naman sya doon ng 
module.tapos kung anu  ang babayaran mo kung membership yan o share capital yan 
so nandun  na sya makikita na un doon sa tellering and then kapag un ay naproces s  na 
ang final output nun ay resibo  
Researher 2: printed by the system ?hindi?  
Ms.Normilyn: hindi los lost ung pang resit naming nakaregister sya bukod sa DIR hindi  
sya ung continuous resit hindi ganun hindi ung printer ang nakaregister  naming sa DIR 
kung di ung resibo. Tapos after noon sa teller lahat ng  loans, sa payments ganun din 
sya then diretso na un sa ledger diretso  sa loan ledger  
Researher 3: ung ledger po nasa system?   
Ms.Normilyn: Nasa Loan module naman sya, sa loan module anim kasi na mo dule yan  
ai..doon sa loan module nandoon naman ung kapag magloloan simula  ng processes 
hanggang sa ledgering,ledgering ng kapag nagbabayad  doon sya nagpopost ang 
kakontra nya ung accounting module ung  accounting module doon naman ung leading 
to financi al report so  basically ganun lang naman sya and the other meron kami na 101 
 
module  na reports na lahat ng module na sinabi ko doon mo sya makikita o  doon mo 
sya pwede e reports o e browse ah Makita e print so ganun  tumatakbo ung system 
namin. Yun lang …  
Researher 3: ah bale Mam ung payment ng loaner may account po ba ung loaner sa  
sarili nila?  
Ms.Normilyn: ah uu…diba sabi ko kanina ginawan ka ng membership  
number,membership account ngayon kung magloloan ka nagcecreate  yan ng P.N 
number Promisory Notes Number,so every time na  magloloan ka may kanya kanyang 
PN yan kaya pagmagbabayad ka  ung PN number na un ang kiniclick para ma post doon 
sa PN number na  un ung payment nya  
Researher 3 :ahh Mam sa website napo makikita ung status nila?  
Ms.Normilyn: ah hindi pa sa ngayon.denedevelop pa sya,kasi sabi ng provider naming  
para maging realtime ung makapagcreate ung mga member naming  doon sa website 
namin tapos Makita nila na realtime ung account ditto  kailangan daw ay may static ID 
kami so k asi wala pa kami static Id sa  ngayon Dynamic pa.ang hirap mag apply sa Pldt 
ng static ID. So un…  Ano pa? Simply ganun lang naman kasi tumatakbo ung system 
kaso di  sya pwede ipakita  
Researher 2: ahm pagmagpapamember po sila may collateral po ba? Anu po ung  mga 
requirements?  
Ms.Normilyn: ah may per membership educational seminar naman so doon po  
eneexplain lahat ng requirements para ikaw ay maging member  including all the 
responsibilities and benefits ng member at saka lahat  ng mga babayaran after ts aka 
kung anu ung mga services na inooffer  ng coop doon ipinapaliwanag  
Researher 2: Mam dip o ba ung coop na ito is regional?  
Ms.Normilyn: hindi ee…hindi mo masasabing regional kami local kami …pila lang  
wala naman kaming ibang branch pero un gaming mag iging members  can be residing 
at region IV un ung area of anu …membership uu kung  baga ung office naming ito lang 
wla naman kaming office sa ibang  lugar  
Researher 1: So ibig sabihin Mam kahit sino pwede magpamember?  
Ms.Normilyn: uu Basta pasok sa amin g requirements working or leaving in region IV  
tapos may classification sya halimbawa may source of income ung mga ganun  
Researher 1 : mam ilang Members po meron dito sa cooperatiba nyo?  
Ms.Normilyn: ung regular member naming ay 2,297.  
Researher 1: So i to mam …ung coop nyo po mam ay nagsimula is 1991 po talaga? 
Ms.Normilyn: uu  
Researher 2: tapos ung mga pinagbago ng system dati is…ung ngayon..  
Ms.Normilyn: ah anu …ung coop kasi nagsimula sya as a constitutional based na coop  
so empleyado lang ng NIA a ng kanilang Myembro so from 1991 to 1999  exclusively for 
the employees lang sya ng NIA bawal ang taga  community  102 
 
Researher 2: ano po ung NIA?  
Ms.Normilyn: National Irrigation Agriculture po diba may national irrigation office  
dito sa may pila?  
Researc hers 1,2,3: opo  
Ms.Normilyn: so ayon…sila ang nagstart noon sila ung aming chairman so  ayon..tapos 
sya ay 1999 nag open sya sa community pila ung nearby  lang pila,Victoria,sta.cruz 
calauan un ung four towns na during those  time manual pa kami lahat 200 2 napalawak 
naming ung mas  nadagdagan ang aming mga member actually nagging region IV lang  
yung aming mga member 2009 na un gaming membership 2009 na  
Researher 2: ah so bale mam yung coop nyo nagstart as agriculture coop lang?  
Ms.Normilyn: hindi,nagsim ula kami sa employees nga salaries hindi kami nagsimula  
as agri.more on salary loan kami kasi un ang profile ng aming mga  member ai   
Researher 3: Tanong ko lang po ngayong may system na kayo may mga naeencounter  
parin po ba kayo na mga problema minor p roblems ganun mam  
Ms.Normilyn: Problema? Anong klaseng mga problema kasi hindi naman nawawala  
ang problema sa office….  
Researher 3: Imean…more on operations po halimbawa dati nawawalan ng data  mga 
ganun  
Ms.Normilyn: ahm…umm…usually ahm nung kami ay na gsisimula di naman intack  
parin ang mga records naming nandyan siya uu kasi dati unti lang  naman ang member 
naming 160 lang very manageable un even sa  posting ng ano…ngayon sa pagdami kasi 
ng member syang pagdami ng  trabaho pero hindi naman kasi pwede hire ka ng hire 
mahal ang cost  ng empleyado so kaya ung sa system naming tatlong attempt naming  
yan.  
Unang attempt hindi nagkaigi kasi gawa ng hindin nila magawa ung  costumized hindi 
nila ma costumized as our policy so hindi nag work  ang unang provide r nay an and 
then ang second provider ok naman  sana nakarating doon sa pagpoproduced ng daily 
relation report kaso  hindi rin natuloy tapos ung last na provider namin nameet naming 
ung  2012 so un ung nakapag costumized talaga kung anu ung ginagamit  
nami n ngayon ang kaibahan lang kasi dati mano mano kami lahat excel  lahat ang 
ginagalaw ngayon ok na talaga sya kasi once na papasok ung  O.R once na napasok 
ung disbursement nasa report na sya pweden ng  gumawa ng MS pede na syang 
iprint..uu kaya sya mabilis …ang  pagrereconseal kasi di yan nawawala kahit naman 
may system kana  may reconciling parin naman yan kasi nagleledger parin naman kami  
kahit na may system nagmamanual ledger parin naman kami  
Researher 2 : tinatale parin…  
Ms.Normilyn: uu tinatale pa rin naman yan di parin naman yan maiiwasan kasi back  
up parin namin un back up naming ung manual ledger..  
Ano pa?  103 
 
Researher 2: so un po un lang gusting malaman naming ung process lang talaga ng  
system  
Ms.Normilyn: so ayun  , basta kung aanuhin ung process ng system ganun sya  
nagsisimula sya sa process ng membership pagbago sya after noon  dahil 
interconnected na sya maviview muna sya sa lahat ng module ung  info ng member na 
iyon dahil interconnected na sya kung magloloan  sya o magbabayad ba sya makikita 
na doon…ayon pag nagbayad na  sya may nifo na pumupunta sa ledger may info na 
pumupunta sa  accounting  
Researher 2: ahh.. ung.. pagbabayad pala nila ng loan nila mam cash on hand? 
Ms.Normilyn: uu  
Researher 2: ahm magkano  naman po ung interest nyo po sa coop po pede po  malaman?  
Ms.Normilyn: sa loan? Ah 1.25% per month..15 % for diminishing..so lahat ng yun  
nakaprogram un sa system basta nagprocess ng loan… ilalagay ung  rate, lalagay ung 
term , ilalagay ung grace period …mga conditions ng  grace period kapag print nyan …  
Researher 3: ung computations po ung system na gumagawa?  
Ms.Normilyn: system na ang gumagawa ng computation and then pati pag aaging ng  
loans recievables naminkasi may grace period kami mga collection list  kung anu due 
mo for the period  
Researher 2: so may mga time din po mam na hindi nakakapagbayad ung mga  
members?  
Ms.Normilyn: uu naman   
Researher 3 : anu po ginagawa nyo doon sa hindi nakakapagbayad?  
Ms.Normilyn: ah wala na syang relation doon sa  system…ibig sabihin ung system ang  
nagpoproduced ng report ah ito ung hindi nagbayad ang action nalang  naming doon 
una demand letter,ang una statement of account nila  kapag di tumugon demand letter 
tapos through abogado na…  
Researher 3: ahh pede ba pa g may tanong kami…pede pa po bumalik?  
Ms.Normilyn: pede naman,kaso pano kaya cguro kay miss sarah nalang pag may

General Manager: ang cooperatiba kasi it o ang tinatawag nating anu standard  and 
sub standard,kaya kailangan namin kayo e orient, kasi para tayo  magkaroon ng 
malinaw na pagtingin doon sa gagawin nyo doon sa  cooperatiba, kasi standard yun 
meron dito standard chart account  marami kasi un,  
Rese arher 1: ano po un sir ? document po siya?

Proponents 1: opo..  
Sir.Bonifacio: oo cge ,kwentuhan muna tayo..ang accounting system procedure kasi  
natin meron kasi tayo syempre yung regulatory agency natin yung civil  a cooperative 
development agency ngayon kasi meron tayong  regulatory agency…  
Researher 2: ibig sabihin john iisa lang,iisa lang talaga ang process ng buong coop.  
Sir.Bonifacio: yung kasing ating cooperatiba,may mandato kasi ang batas. Diba  meron 
tayong tinatawag na security and exchange commission meron  tayo noon, ang 
kinocover lang kasi ng exchange commission ung  mga  ,corporation,asussasyon yung 
mga partnership at saka foundation.yun  yun yung kinocover nila bale apat..di ba may 
resibo yan? Lahat yan  kaya pinarerehistro sa security and exchange commission para  
magkaroon ng tinatawag theoretical personality ibig  sabihin may  pagkatao siya kaya 
ka nakakapag open ng account ng corporation  
ai…kinonsidera sila na isang lihitimo ano, merong representation kasi  sya, un ung 
securities and exchange commission. Yung surproprietor diba meron tayo 
yungsurproprietor mga ma y tindahan,sari -sari store minsan ay tao lang ang 
nagmamanage ang tawag natin jan ay  surproprietor inirerehistro yan sa DTI 
Deparment of Trade and industry  ikinukuha syang business namepag narehistro na sya 
sa dti  marerehistro nadin sya sa BIR. Hindi ka  makakarehistro sa BIR kasi di  ka 
rehistro sa dti kasi hahanapin yun,ganun din naman yung  corporation hahanapan ng 
certificate of incorporators nyo para kayo  ay mabigyan ng certification na pwede kayo 
mag imprinta ng resibo na  yun ang tinatawag natin n a permit of print ganun din ang 
coop ang  coop naman hindi kasama doon sa securities and exchange commission hindi 
rin sya kasama doon sa Dti meron syang provider ang cooperatiba  meron syang 
sariling batas yun ang tinatawag natin na republic act  9520 na kung saan kasi ang 
lahat ng cooperatiba ay kailangan na  mairehistro sa ilalim ng CDA Cooperative 
Development Authority  pagkarehistro sa CDA syempre mag iissue ng certificate of 
Registrartion  katulad sa Security and exchange commissioning certificate of  105 
 
registration nila iiissue nila para makakuha din ng resibo at maka  access sa 
pagkakaroon pagbibigay ng resibo ng ibig sabihin ng mga  yan ay may corresponding 
na resibo.hindi pwedeng walang resibo.kaya  doon tayo magsisimua sa resibo doon 
papasok ung acc ounting system  and procedure natin kaya ung resibo natin maraming 
klase  syempremeron tayong ung tinatawag natin na official receipt,lahat ng  perang 
pumapasok satin official receipt ang ginagamit doon.meron din  tinatawag nating sales 
invoicepag ikaw ang  nabili dalawang klase pa  nga yun,yung iba ginagawa may charge 
invoice saka ung isa sales  invoiceyung iba naman sales invoice nalang ang ginagawa 
pero  definitely yung dalawang yun ay..  
Researher 2: sales invoice ang kadalasang ginagamit?  
Sir.Bonifacio : oo kadalasang ginagamit ung sales invoice …ngayon ung sales invoice  
natin syempre lahat ng kailangan sa pamimili may sales invoice lahat  yan,nagbenta ka 
ng sapatos ng tsinelas ng kung ano ano lahat ng may  commodities karne, gulay ,isda 
dapat ay may re sibo yan…pero di na  nangyayari un wala ng resibo yan.di 
nanereresibuhan yan maliban na  lamang kung doon ka bibili sa mga grocery yun ay 
nareresibuhan.ibalik  natin ang kwento kung ano yung mga devices ,kung may resibo 
kayo ?  ung official reciept naman u ng lahat ng bagay na tatanggapin mo na cash pera 
,pag ikaw ng pera sa costumer mo ng cash pero hindi ka  nagbenta , halimbawa ganito 
naniningil ka reresibuhan mo sinisingil m,  halimbawa nagbayad ka ng mga bills mo sa 
munisipyo meron sa  munisipyo standard  chart ah..standard na ung resibo nila ah sa  
government kasi standard na ang mga resibo nyan, may logo na ng  republic of the 
Philippines un kanilang resibo pero yung mga private hindi ganyan,ibig sabihin ung 
bawat ano gobyerno ay dapat may  standard na r esibo, yun kasi ung pangunahing  
pangangailangan.dalawa lang yan kung saino ung nag abot ng pera o  nagbayad ng 
pera sa kanya ung original na kopya ng resiboyun un, sabi  ko sa inyo una , papasok 
ang pera sa pamamagitan ng collection at sa  
pamamagitan ng pagbebenta.pwede din naman ang serbisyo ang  ibenta mohalimbawa 
naga ka ng washing machine reresibuhan mo  yun.na kahit di ka naman nagbenta 
nangulekta ka may resibo ka  syempre.ganun ung takbo ng sitwasyon naguumpisa lagi 
tayo sa  resibo.ngayon yun ay sa papasok na pera . paano naman yung sa  palabas na 
pera?ang tawag naman dito ay disbursement papalabas na  pera ,gastos. Sa paglalabas 
ng pera kung corporation yan hindi ka  pwede kumuha ng pera doon para sa personal 
mong pangangailangan.bawal yoon..halimba wa ikaw ang kahera ikaw ang  cashier? 
Hindi mo pedeng galawin ung pera hanggat walang  authorized ng may ari.kasi kung 
sa cooperatiba pera yan ng  nakararami ung kahera ang trabaho nya halimbawa is taga 
paglabas  lang ng pera .yun ang treasurer at hindi ka  pupwedeng maglabas ng  pera 
kung halimbawa iniutos ng manager maliban na lamang kung  may mga polisiya kayo 
o patakaran pinaiiral kayo .  
Researher 2: kahit ang may ari po ang nag uutos?  
Sir.Bonifacio: uu kahit ang may ari ang nag uutos depende sa sitwas yon ah..ikaw  bilang 
bookkeeper o cashier.oh sige,sige direktahin na natin bilang  cooperatiba sa 
cooperatiba tayo lahat ng cooperatiba na pupuntahan  ninyo siguraduhin nyo na 
gumagamit ng official receipt.kahit na maliit  na halaga para sa prof of payment  un 
yung uanag dapat na  maestablish ninyo dito.meron din tayo ditto na tinatawag na  106 
 
miscellaneous expense na hindi ka pwedeng gumamit ng sarili mong  dukot bulsa para 
halimbawa sa bisita kasi meron din tayong batas para  riyan kaya dapat maging 
pamilyar din kayo doon sa system ng  accounting.meron din diyan tinatawag natin na 
disclosure statement  yung sa disclosure statement naman syempre doon nakalagay kung  
magkano ang interest magkano ang service fee edededuct ba ito in  advance or hindi..  
Researher 1: .nakalagay po ba doon kung long term or short term?  
Sir.Bonifacio: uu uhmm…ung disclosure statement nakalagay doon ung term ,amount  
of loan, loan interest ,service fee and other charges..kailangan proper  disclosed  
Researher 2: anu yun sir? Parang ag reement?  
Sir.Bonifacio: bukod pa yung agreement promissory note ang tawag doon Researher 2: 
yung disclosure statement?  
Sir.Bonifacio: yung tinatawag natin na disclosure statement un ung lahat ng charges  e 
didisclose mo  
Researher 2: ahhhh…  
Sir.Bonifacio: ibig sabihin ibubulgar mo sa kanya,hindi pwede na deniduckan ka ng  
nakatago.  
Researher 3: ahm sir ibig sabihin ung promissory note at disclosure statement  
magkakasama po sila ? magkakasama po sila sa iisang documents?  
Sir.Bonifacio: alin?  Ahm ..a oo magkakasama sila  
Sir.Bonifacio: (may tumatawag sa cp ni sir boni sinagot nya muna) oh ano san nab a  
tayo ?pasensya na at may tumawag ai…   
Researher 3 :ung promissory note po ba ano po ba un?  
Sir.Bonifacio: ah..ang promissory note kasi ito u ng sumpaang pagbabayadna kung  
saan nakalagay doon kung saan ba manggagaling ang ibabayad mo ito  ba ay salary 
deduction,ito po bay mangagaling sa yong  halamanan,tsaka sakali paano mo ito 
babayaran,doon papasok ung  sistema ng pagbabayad naman halimbawa a ng 
napagkasunduan natin  ay buwanang babayaran halimbawa ung sampung libong piso 
mona  utang babayaran mo lang ng sampong buwan sa medaling sabi 10000  pesos will 
be divided to 10 months ibig sabihin nito every months  magbabayad ka plus ung interest 
na ba bayaran mo un un…  
Researher 2: iba iba po ba ang interest?  
Sir.Bonifacio: hindi ai ang interest kasi ay ang computation kasi nyan percentage laging 
pinag uusapan diyan per anum..or annually o yearly Pag sinabi  nating 10% per anum 
ibig sabihin sampung po rsyento sa loob ng isang  taon labing dalawang buwan pero 
may ibat iabng uri ng computation  un pa rin ang problema ninyo merong straight line 
at meron din  diminishing balance mejo masalimoot ano? Kaya nga sabi ko sa inyo  
hindi ganun kadali ang sistema…  
Researher 2: eh sir di po ba ang kadalasan na nagiging collateral is ung atm? Eh  paano 
naman po pag walang atm?  107 
 
Sir.Bonifacio: ganito kasi yan..kung ikaw ay mangungutang sa coop tapos meron  kang 
share capital na 5000 pesos share capital ibig sabihin ay  share  kung sa coop ay share 
of stock ano pero minimum ung share namin  para maging member kami ng cooperatiba 
ung investment namin na  limang libo ngayon pede kami makautang ng 10,000 
pesoshanggang  doon lang un sampung libo lang ang pwede namin mautang at hindi  
kami pwede tumaas doon.bakit? Times 2 ng share capital iyon ujnh  yong isang 
patakaran walang collateral ito ang nakacollkateral sa iyo  ay ang iyong share 
capitaland plus the policy na iyong share capital ay  pede nilang edouble. Ayon ang 
tawag sa loan na ito ay character loan  ang kridibilidad mo ang nakataya dito.  
Researher 1: pede po ba makulong ang taong yun pag hindi sya nagbayad ng utang? 
Sir.Bonifacio: uu!makukulang ka at may promissory note ai…may pinirmahan ka ai… 
Researher 1 : pwede ka ng kasuhan?  
Sir.Bonifacio: .uu pwede kang kasuhan may pronisorry note ai…pero walang  collateral 
character lang..o pwedeng ang benefits mo kunin..  
Researher 1: sir kung paano po black listed ako sa palasan ngayon black listed na din  
po ba ako dito?  
Sir.Bonifacio: yaan ang ginagawaan ng paraan ngayon kasi wala pa ng system na  
ganyan ayaw kasi ng cooperatiba na magcomply doon meron kasing  sistema ngayon 
na tawag nila ay Cisa cisa yun ata cisa cooperative  information system act na lahat ng 
cooperatiba ma greregister doon kaya ang mangyayari nga nito…  
Researher 2: sir   
Sir.Bonifacio: oh ano?  
Researher 2: dip o ba sabi nyo ung mga coop ang magreregister doon ? dip o ba  pwede 
na kayo nalang ang magparegister sa kanila?  
Sir.Bonifacio: ganito kasi  sir yun…alam mo tayo napapalibutan tayo ng batas  
ai…meron tayo nyang system act nayan no…ngayon meron tayong  tinatawag na data 
privacy act eh ang tawag jan ay disclosure .eh pano  na ngayon yan ung tinatawag ng 
bangko na secrecy may secracy act  pa may batas pa na hindi mo pede e disclose yung 
information mo nayung bangko ioopen sa iyo e di ka naming bangko ibig sabihin wala  
ka nama.ng authority. Yan daming mga batas ai na kung saan  bumabangga doon sa 
cooperative information system act na kung saan  ku ng ikaw ay may utang malalaman 
ng buong cooperatiba na may  utang ka ditto pwedeng magamit un favorable sayo o 
laban sa iyo  bakit? Kasi may mga issues kasi na bayad na pero hindi updated eh  bayad 
na ako tapos lalabas ngayon doon sa computer may utang pa  ako e di kasiraan un sa 
kridibilidad ko pupunta ako ngayon doon sa  cooperatiba ng certification gumawgaw 
na gumulo na bakit? Ung  cooperatiba na nag upload ng information ko di nya na update 
.  
Researcher 2: ah ok ok…  
Sir.Bonifacio: so paano kung gusto nyo ung sa sistema nyo ay kailangan kung gusto  
nyo ma orient namin kayo kasi siguro pa schedule kayo pero siguro mga  
Monday…andito kami lahat siguro noon…ang kailngan nyo rin kasi  malaman ang 108 
 
accounting din sa cooperatiba siguro kailangan nyo din  ma or ient sa ganun…kasi dib 
a may flow car yan ?  
Researher 2: ah opo opo meron po…

ung mga coop na parepareho sa  distrito halimbawa  puro mga agri o kaya credit basta 
pareparehas ng hanapbuhay o ng  mga negosyo you can federate all those coop in one 
single federation  ha pwede mo sila buuin pero sa bawat municipyo sa bawat syodan

A pleasant day! We, the students of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
from the College of Computer Studies at Laguna State Polytechnic Uni versity, Sta. 
Cruz Campus, were taking subjects for ITEP 313 (Methods of Research). With regards 
of this subject, we are required to create a Computer System which serves as our final 
project for the completion of the said subject.  
 
In connection to this,  we would like to ask your office if we could perform an initial 
investigation including an interview and observation as a part of our data gathering 
which could help us in formulating a solution to the office’s possible problem. This 
project would be bene ficial not only for us students to pass but most importantly, it 
will help you, specifically with the operations of this office.  
 
If you will agree with regards of this matter, we would like to ask your permission to 
allow us gather some information which  would help us to complete this project.  
 
We are hoping for your approval and cooperation. Thank you and God bless.
